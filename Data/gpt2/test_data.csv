"[SOC]###context: Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and mild intellectual disability in a patient with a novel de novo truncating TRIM8 mutation.  Mutations in the TRIM8 gene have been described in patients with severe developmental delay, intellectual disability and epilepsy.  Only six patients have been described to date.  All the previous mutations were truncating variants clustered in the C-terminus of the protein.  A previous patient with TRIM8-related epileptic encephalopathy was reported to have nephrotic syndrome.  Here we describe the clinical, radiological and histological features of an 8-year-old male patient with a TRIM8 mutation who, in contrast to previous patients, had only mild intellectual disability and well-controlled epilepsy.  The patient was found to have proteinuria at 2 years of age.  Renal biopsy findings were suggestive of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.  His kidney function declined and peritoneal dialysis was started at 5 years of age.  He underwent renal transplant at 7 years of age.  Trio-based whole genome sequencing identified a novel de novo heterozygous frameshift mutation in TRIM8 (NM_030912. 2) c. 1198_1220del, p. (Tyr400ArgfsTer2).  This patient is further evidence that TRIM8 mutations cause a syndrome with both neurological and renal features.  Our findings suggest the spectrum of TRIM8-related disease may be wider than previously thought with the possibility of milder neurodevelopmental problems and/or a more severe, progressive renal phenotype.  We highlight the need for proteinuria screening in patients with TRIM8 mutations. 
###question: Which conditions are manifested by TRIM8 mutations?[EOC] [SOR]###response: TRIM8 mutations are associated with epilepsy, epileptic encephalopathy, developmental delay and intellectual disability. [EOR]"

"[SOC]###context: Lubeluzole showed promising neuroprotective effects in animal stroke models, but failed to show benefits in acute ischemic stroke in humans.   However, clinical research on lubeluzole is now at a standstill, since lubeluzole seems to be associated with the acquired long QT syndrome and ventricular arrhythmias.   Ten classes of neuroprotective agents have reached phase III efficacy trials but have shown mixed results.  They included calcium channel antagonists, NMDA receptor antagonists, lubeluzole, CDP-choline, the free radical scavenger tirilazad and ebselen, enlimomab, GABA agonist clomethiazole, the sodium channel antagonist fosphenytoin, magnesium, glycine site antagonist GV150526 and piracetam.   CONCLUSIONS: This study failed to show an efficacy of lubeluzole in the treatment of acute stroke.   Overall, of all treated patients, 401 (22. 5%) died: 203 (22. 5%) in the lubeluzole group and 198 (22. 4%) with placebo.  Of all subjects treated, 853 (95%) on lubeluzole and 826 (93%) on placebo reported an adverse event during their treatment period or within the next 2 days after discontinuation of treatment.  CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with lubeluzole within 6 hours of the onset of ischemic stroke had a nonsignificant effect on mortality and resulted in improved clinical outcome compared with placebo, with no safety concerns.  RESULTS: The overall mortality rate at 12 weeks for lubeluzole-treated patients was 20. 7% compared to 25. 2% for placebo-treated patients (NS).  Controlling for relevant covariates, the degree of neurological recovery (NIHSS) at week 12 significantly favored lubeluzole over placebo (P = . 033).  Lubeluzole treatment similarly resulted in significantly greater improvements in functional status (Barthel Index) (P = . 038) and overall disability (Rankin Scale) (P = . 034) after 12 weeks.  A global test statistic confirmed that lubeluzole-treated patients had a more favorable clinical outcome at 12 weeks (P = . 041).  CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute ischemic stroke, the dosage regimen of 7. 5 mg over 1 hour followed by 10 mg/d of intravenous lubeluzole is safe and statistically significantly reduced mortality.   CONCLUSIONS  Treatment with lubeluzole within 6 hours of the onset of ischemic stroke had a nonsignificant effect on mortality and resulted in improved clinical outcome compared with placebo, with no safety concerns.  CONCLUSIONS: Lubeluzole, given in the acute phase of ischaemic stroke, is not associated with a significant reduction of death or dependency at the end of scheduled follow-up period but seems to be associated with a significant increase of heart-conduction disorders (Q-T prolonged >450 msec).  Treatment with lubeluzole within 6 hours of the onset of ischemic stroke had a nonsignificant effect on mortality and resulted in improved clinical outcome compared with placebo, with no safety concerns.  In the overall study population, treatment with intravenous lubeluzole within 6 h of the onset of ischaemic stroke did not affect mortality or clinical outcome.

"[SOC]###context: Homozygous mutations of EDNRB in human have been reported to result in Waardenburg-Hirschsprung disease (WS4), while mutated heterozygotes manifested isolated Hirschsprung disease in lower penetrance The index patient, who was born to a family with no history of Hirschsprung disease, presented total colonic aganglionosis with small bowel extension, sensorineural hearing loss and generalized cutaneous pigmentary defects.  Interestingly, both irides were normally black.  The study detected a homozygous missense mutation at codon 196 in exon 2 (Ser196Asn), which has not been reported.  Both parents and four in six siblings harbored heterozygous mutation without any clinical manifestation.  Our findings were consistent with previous observations that full spectrum of WS4 occurred to the mutate homozygotes.  Moreover, the non-penetrance of heterozygotes in our pedigree, which differs from other reports, demonstrates the high pleiotropic effect of EDNRB mutations in human.  Our own studies could show that, whereas a homozygous mutation of EDNRB causes long-segment HSCR, a heterozygous EDNRB deficiency leads to alterations of the ENS resembling the histopathology observed in intestinal neuronal dysplasia ABCD syndrome is an autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by albinism, black lock, cell migration disorder of the neurocytes of the gut (Hirschsprung disease [HSCR]), and deafness.  This phenotype clearly overlaps with the features of the Shah-Waardenburg syndrome, comprising sensorineural deafness; hypopigmentation of skin, hair, and irides; and HSCR.  Therefore, we screened DNA of the index patient of the ABCD syndrome family for mutations in the endothelin B receptor (EDNRB) gene, a gene known to be involved in Shah-Waardenburg syndrome.  A homozygous nonsense mutation in exon 3 (R201X) of the EDNRB gene was found.  We therefore suggest that ABCD syndrome is not a separate entity, but an expression of Shah-Waardenburg syndrome.  Three susceptibility genes have been recently identified in HSCR, namely the RET proto-oncogene, the endothelin B receptor (EDNRB) gene, and the endothelin 3 (EDN3) gene.  RET gene mutations were found in significant proportions of familial (50%) and sporadic (15-20%) HSCR, while homozygosity for EDNRB or EDN3 mutations accounted for the rare HSCR-Waardenburg syndrome (WS) association.

"[SOC]###context: LEM-3 is a midbody-tethered DNA nuclease that resolves chromatin bridges during late mitosis.  Using C.  elegans embryos we show that the LEM-3/Ankle1 nuclease defines a previously undescribed genome integrity mechanism by processing DNA bridges right before cells divide.  LEM-3 acts at the midbody, the structure where abscission occurs at the end of cytokinesis.  LEM-3 localization depends on factors needed for midbody assembly, and LEM-3 accumulation is increased and prolonged when chromatin bridges are trapped at the cleavage plane.  LEM-3 locally processes chromatin bridges that arise from incomplete DNA replication, unresolved recombination intermediates, or the perturbance of chromosome structure.  Proper LEM-3 midbody localization and function is regulated by AIR-2/Aurora B kinase.  Strikingly, LEM-3 acts cooperatively with the BRC-1/BRCA1 homologous recombination factor to promote genome integrity.  These findings provide a molecular basis for the suspected role of the LEM-3 orthologue Ankle1 in human breast cancer.  The conserved LEM-3/Ankle1 nuclease is involved in the combinatorial regulation of meiotic recombination repair and chromosome segregation in Caenorhabditis elegans.  Here we show that the LEM-3 nuclease, mutation of which by itself does not have an overt meiotic phenotype, genetically interacts with slx-1 and mus-81 mutants, the respective double mutants displaying 100% embryonic lethality.  The combined loss of LEM-3 and MUS-81 leads to altered processing of recombination intermediates, a delayed disassembly of foci associated with CO designated sites, and the formation of univalents linked by SPO-11 dependent chromatin bridges (dissociated bivalents).  However, LEM-3 foci do not colocalize with ZHP-3, a marker that congresses into CO designated sites.  In addition, neither CO frequency nor distribution is altered in lem-3 single mutants or in combination with mus-81 or slx-4 mutations.  Finally, we found persistent chromatin bridges during meiotic divisions in lem-3; slx-4 double mutants.  Supported by the localization of LEM-3 between dividing meiotic nuclei, this data suggest that LEM-3 is able to process erroneous recombination intermediates that persist into the second meiotic division.

"[SOC]###context: Here I show that CpG islands were associated not only with methylation-free promoters but also with nucleosome-free promoters.  Nucleosome-free regions were observed only in promoters containing a CpG island In contrast to the methylation-and nucleosome-free states of CpG-island promoters, exons were densely methylated at CpGs and packaged into nucleosomes.  I also found that nucleosomes, DNA methylation, and H3K36me3 marked the exons of transcripts with low, medium, and high gene expression levels, respectively.  Human promoters containing a CpG island tend to remain nucleosome-free as well as methylation-free.  In contrast, exons demonstrate a high degree of methylation and nucleosome occupancy.  Exonic DNA methylation seems to function together with exonic nucleosomes and H3K36me3 for the proper splicing of transcripts with different expression levels.  Supporting such an association, recent reports have identified distinct histone methylation patterns, elevated nucleosome occupancy and enriched DNA methylation at exons relative to introns.  DNA methylation directly silences genes with non-CpG island promoters and establishes a nucleosome occupied promoter.  Using a novel bioinformatics pipeline, we show a striking anti-correlation between nucleosome occupancy and DNA methylation at CTCF regions that is not present at promoters.   Three positions at the splice sites show high CpG abundance and accompany elevated nucleosome occupancy in a leveled GC architecture.  The first group has higher nucleosome occupancy on exons than introns, whereas the second group exhibits weak nucleosome marking of exons, suggesting another type of epigenetic marker distinguishes exons from introns when GC content is similar.   DNA methylation can determine nucleosome positioning.   DNA methylation determines nucleosome occupancy in the 5'-CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes.  he induction of DNA hypomethylation events by genetic (DNMT1/DNMT3B deficient cells) or drug (a DNA demethylating agent) approaches is associated with the eviction of nucleosomes from previously hypermethylated CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes.  Using this global approach, we observe the dependency of nucleosome occupancy upon the DNA methylation status.  Thus, our results suggest that there is a close association between hypermethylated CpG islands and the presence of nucleosomes, such that each of these epigenetic mechanisms can determine the recruitment of the other.  Although global DNA demethylation has been observed after treatment, it is unclear to what extent demethylation induces changes in nucleosome occupancy, a key determinant of gene expression.  Our results indicate that only a minority of demethylated promoters are associated with nucleosome remodeling, and these could potentially be the epigenetic drivers causing the loss of tumorigenicity.  with repressed genes often being associated with local DNA hypermethylation and gain of nucleosomes at their promoters.  Transcription, histone modifications, and DNA methylation alter this ""ground state"" by having distinct effects on both nucleosome positioning and occupancy.   In order to systematically evaluate potential diversities among CGIs and ultimately to illuminate the link between diversity of CGIs and their epigenetic variation, we analyzed the nucleotide-resolution DNA methylation maps (methylomes) of multiple cellular origins.  The mostly unmethylated CpG islands have reduced nucleosome occupancy and are enriched in cell type-independent binding sites for CTCF.  In contrast, outside of CpG islands most CpGs are methylated, and the average methylation density oscillates so that it is highest in the linker region between nucleosomes.  Aberrant acquisition of nucleosomes at enhancer-associated NDRs is associated with hypermethylation and epigenetic silencing marks, and conversely, loss of nucleosomes with demethylation and epigenetic activation.  Prominent exceptions to the correlations between methylated CpG density and nucleosome occupancy include CpG islands marked by H3K27me3 and CpG-poor heterochromatin marked by H3K9me3, and these modifications, along with DNA methylation, distinguish the major silencing mechanisms of the human epigenome.  Throughout the genome, nucleosome occupancy was correlated with certain histone methylation or acetylation modifications.  We further show that the extent of nucleosome depletion at promoters is directly correlated to expression level and can accommodate multiple nucleosomes and provide genome-wide evidence that expressed non-CpG island promoters are nucleosome-depleted.

"[SOC]###context: The authors describe a patient experiencing stridor and dysphagia with confirmed pulmonary restriction and aspiration following subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulator adjustment, with a resolution of symptoms and signs when the stimulator was switched off.  Stridor was not noted during sleep at night.  Endoscopic examination of the larynx revealed insufficient abduction of the bilateral vocal cords, although the glottis was not so small as to cause stridor during inspiration.   The stridor was specific to MSA.   Patients with MSA can present other clinical features, such as inspiratory stridor and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD).  We report a patient with pathologically confirmed MSA who presented with a longstanding history of stridor, RBD and autonomic disturbances but did not develop overt parkinsonism or cerebellar signs.  This case illustrates that MSA may present clinically without its cardinal motor symptoms, and that stridor and RBD may be clues to recognise the disease in a patient with autonomic failure.  Patients with PD did not display sleep hypoventilation, stridor and abnormal central sleep apnea.   DEVELOPMENT: Autonomic disorders such as seborrhoeic dermatitis and disorders involving sweating, fatigue, weight loss or respiratory problems (dyspnea, inspiratory stridor) are highly prevalent and very disabling symptoms.  In addition, they may be the main problem in a particular phase of PD (fatigue, stridor) and condition the quality of life of patients with Parkinson.   .  Her dyspneic attacks consisting of inspiratory stridor and cyanosis occurred mainly during the wearing-off time and continued for less than 30 min The most commonly reported sleep disorders were sleep fragmentation (52. 5%), vocalisation (60%), REM sleep behaviour disorder (47. 5%), and nocturnal stridor (19%).  Except for sleep fragmentation, the incidence of these disorders was significantly higher than in PD Six days after admission, dyspnea and inspiratory stridor were noted, and the respiratory distress worsened.   A patient is described with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and severe laryngeal stridor.  The laryngeal stridor responded to levodopa therapy, and we are not aware that this has been reported previously.  The subsequent clinical course of the former eight patients has been typical of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, whilst the ninth patient has developed postural hypotension, urinary incontinence and respiratory stridor typical of multiple system atrophy.   Although each of five autonomic domains was affected in variable numbers of IPD patients, AD in MSA generally involved more autonomic domains than in IPD, and to a more severe degree, in particular with regard to inspiratory stridor.  However, the presence of severe AD, of AD preceding parkinsonism, or of inspiratory stridor, are all individually suggestive of MSA.  Apart from dysautonomia, the principal discriminant clinical features that distinguished SND from PD were the early appearance of the following symptoms and signs: (a) severe and atypical progressive parkinsonism characterized by bilateral bradykinesia and rigidity, slowness of gait, postural instability, and falls, and poor or absent response to adequate levodopa treatment; (b) increased tendon reflexes associated or not with frank pyramidal signs, severe dysarthria, and less consistently, dysphagia, stridor, antecollis, and stimulus-sensitive myoclonus, which, when present, are highly suggestive of the disease.  OBJECTIVES: (1) To present a rare case of stridor secondary to prolonged laryngospasm in a patient with Parkinson's disease, and (2) to review the literature on stridor in Parkinson's disease.  METHODS: We report a 73-year-old Parkinson's disease patient who developed acute stridor due to prolonged laryngospasm triggered by overspill of excessive secretions.

This case emphasises the importance of recognising different causes of stridor in Parkinson's disease patients, as this affects management.

"[SOC]###context: Ferroportin disease is a rare type of autosomal dominantly inherited hemochromatosis caused with mutations in the ferroportin gene (SLC40A1).  The patients characteristically have hyperferritinemia but normal transferin saturations.   Novel gain of function mutation in the SLC40A1 gene associated with hereditary haemochromatosis type 4.  Here we report the case of a 69-year-old Chinese Han woman who presented with liver cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, skin hyperpigmentation, hyperferritinaemia and high transferrin saturation.  Subsequent genetic analyses identified a novel heterozygous mutation (p. Cys326Phe) in the SLC40A1 gene.   A novel mutation in the SLC40A1 gene associated with reduced iron export in vitro.  Ferroportin disease is an inherited disorder of iron metabolism and is caused by mutations in the ferroportin gene (SLC40A1).  We present a patient with hyperferritinemia, iron overload in the liver with reticuloendothelial distribution and also in the spleen, and under treatment with erythropheresis.   These findings and the iron overload phenotype of the patient suggest that the novel mutation c. 386T>C (p. L129P) in the SLC40A1 gene has incomplete penetrance and causes the classical form of ferroportin disease.  Ferroportin (FPN) mediates iron export from cells and this function is modulated by serum hepcidin.  Mutations in the FPN gene (SLC40A1) lead to autosomal dominant iron overload diseases related either to loss or to gain of function, and usually characterized by normal or low transferrin saturation versus elevated transferrin saturation, respectively.   Hemochromatosis type 4 is a rare form of primary iron overload transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait caused by mutations in the gene encoding the iron transport protein ferroportin 1 (SLC40A1).  SLC40A1 mutations fall into two functional categories (loss- versus gain-of-function) underlying two distinct clinical entities (hemochromatosis type 4A versus type 4B).  However, the vast majority of SLC40A1 mutations are rare missense variations, with only a few showing strong evidence of causality.   p. C282Y mutation and rare variants in the HFE gene have been associated with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH).  HH is also caused by mutations in other genes, such as the hemojuvelin (HJV), hepcidin (HAMP), transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2) and ferroportin (SLC40A1).   Two novel mutations in the SLC40A1 and HFE genes implicated in iron overload in a Spanish man.  Ferroportin disease is characterized by iron overload.  It has an autosomal-dominant pattern of inheritance and has been associated with mutations in the SLC40A1 gene, which encodes the cellular iron exporter ferroportin.  Mutations in the SLC40A1 gene, which encodes ferroportin, are associated with autosomal dominant hemochromatosis.  Ferroportin is inhibited directly by hepcidin, a key iron-regulatory peptide, and functional consequences of SLC40A1 mutations account for observed phenotypic differences in patients with ferroportin disease.   The entire coding sequence of the SLC40A1 gene was sequenced in a pedigree, presenting with autosomal dominant hyperferritinemia.  A novel SLC40A1 mutation p. R489K segregated with iron overload in a family with clinical and histopathological signs of macrophage-type ferroportin disease.   We report a novel pathological SLC40A1 variant associated with abnormal cell surface expression of ferroportin due to intracellular retention of the mutant protein.  These findings predict macrophage-type ferroportin disease, the phenotype observed in this kindred.  Study of the molecular cell biology of ferroportin and its mutants is key to understanding the pathogenesis of this increasingly recognized form of hemochromatosis, which responds poorly to conventional therapy.  Classical ferroportin disease is characterized by hyperferritinemia, normal transferrin saturation, and iron overload in macrophages.  A non-classical form is characterized by additional hepatocellular iron deposits and a high transferrin saturation.  Both forms demonstrate autosomal dominant transmission and are associated with ferroportin gene (SLC40A1) mutations.   Mutations in the SLC40A1 gene result in a dominant genetic disorder [ferroportin disease; hereditary hemochromatosis type (HH) IV], characterized by iron overload with two different clinical manifestations, normal transferrin saturation with macrophage iron accumulation (the most prevalent type) or high transferrin saturation with hepatocyte iron accumulation (classical hemochromatosis phenotype).  SLC40A1 gene mutations are associated with an autosomal type of genetic iron overload described as haemochromatosis type 4, or HFE4 (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man number 606069), or ferroportin disease.  Ferroportin disease is an inherited disorder of iron metabolism and is caused by mutations in the ferroportin gene (SLC40A1).  Mutations in the SLC40A1 gene, which encodes ferroportin, are associated with autosomal dominant hemochromatosis.  A Japanese family with ferroportin disease caused by a novel mutation of SLC40A1 gene: hyperferritinemia associated with a relatively low transferrin saturation of iron.  These findings and the iron overload phenotype of the patient suggest that the novel mutation c. 386T>C (p. L129P) in the SLC40A1 gene has incomplete penetrance and causes the classical form of ferroportin disease.  UNLABELLED: Mutations in the SLC40A1 gene, which encodes ferroportin, are associated with autosomal dominant hemochromatosis.  This deletion affects not only COL3A1 but also 21 other known genes (GULP1, DIRC1, COL5A2, WDR75, SLC40A1, ASNSD1, ANKAR, OSGEPL1, ORMDL1, LOC100129592, PMS1, MSTN, C2orf88, HIBCH, INPP1, MFSD6, TMEM194B, NAB1, GLS, STAT1, and STAT4), mutations in three of which (COL5A2, SLC40A1, and MSTN) have also been associated with an autosomal dominant disorder (EDS classical type, hemochromatosis type 4, and muscle hypertrophy).  Analysis of SLC40A1 gene at the mRNA level reveals rapidly the causative mutations in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis type IV.  The iron overload was similar to that observed in HFE hemochromatosis, and the patient was double heterozygous for two novel mutations, c. -20G>A and c. 718A>G (p. K240E), in the HFE and ferroportin (FPN1 or SLC40A1) genes, respectively.

The proposed procedure would facilitate the wide-range molecular analysis of the SLC40A1 gene, contributing to better understanding the pathogenesis of the ferroportin disease.  Mutations in the SLC40A1 gene result in a dominant genetic disorder [ferroportin disease; hereditary hemochromatosis type (HH) IV], characterized by iron overload with two different clinical manifestations, normal transferrin saturation with macrophage iron accumulation (the most prevalent type) or high transferrin saturation with hepatocyte iron accumulation (classical hemochromatosis phenotype).   Type IV hemochromatosis is associated with dominant mutations in the SLC40A1 gene encoding ferroportin (FPN).  It has an autosomal-dominant pattern of inheritance and has been associated with mutations in the SLC40A1 gene, which encodes the cellular iron exporter ferroportin.  SLC40A1 gene mutations are associated with an autosomal type of genetic iron overload described as haemochromatosis type 4, or HFE4 (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man number 606069), or ferroportin disease.

"[SOC]###context: The zinc-finger protein Zelda is a key activator of the early zygotic genome in Drosophila Here we report that the zinc-finger protein Zelda (Zld; Zinc-finger early Drosophila activator) binds specifically to these sites and is capable of activating transcription in transient transfection assays.  We demonstrated that Grh and the previously characterized transcriptional activator Zelda (Zld) bind to different TAGteam sequences with varying affinities, and that Grh competes with Zld for TAGteam occupancy.  Recently the discovery of the transcriptional activator Zelda (Zld), which binds to CAGGTAG and related sequences present in the enhancers of many early-activated genes in Drosophila, hinted at a mechanism for how batteries of genes could be simultaneously activated.  In Drosophila, the MZT is preceded by the transcription of a small number of genes that initiate sex determination, patterning, and other early developmental processes; and the zinc-finger protein Zelda (ZLD) plays a key role in their transcriptional activation The Drosophila Zelda transcription factor plays an important role in regulating transcription at the embryonic maternal-to-zygotic transition.  n summary, Zelda collaborates with bHLH-PAS proteins to directly regulate midline and tracheal expression of an evolutionary dynamic enhancer in the post-blastoderm embryo.  We demonstrate that increasing the number of Zelda binding sites accelerates the kinetics of nuclei transcriptional activation regardless of their transcriptional past.   We propose that Zelda facilitates transcriptional activation by accumulating in microenvironments where it could accelerate the duration of multiple pre-initiation steps.  The zinc-finger TF zelda (zld) is essential for the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) in Drosophila melanogaster, where it directly binds over thousand cis-regulatory modules to regulate chromatin accessibility.   Further, we also demonstrate that zld is critical for posterior segmentation in the hemipteran Rhodnius prolixus, indicating this function predates the origin of holometabolous insects and was subsequently lost in long-germ insects.  Overall our analysis suggests that GAF, together with Zelda, plays an important role in activating the zygotic genome  In Drosophila melanogaster, the transcription factor Zelda plays an essential role in widespread activation of the zygotic genome This demonstrates that highly regulated levels of Zelda activity are required for establishing the developmental program during the MZT Zelda overcomes the high intrinsic nucleosome barrier at enhancers during Drosophila zygotic genome activation.  Here, we analyze the effect of Zld on genome-wide nucleosome occupancy and binding of the patterning TF Dorsal (Dl).  Our results show that early enhancers are characterized by an intrinsically high nucleosome barrier.  Zld tackles this nucleosome barrier through local depletion of nucleosomes with the effect being dependent on the number and position of Zld motifs Open chromatin is associated with Zelda-bound loci, as well as more generally with regions of active transcription In Drosophila, the DNA-binding protein Zelda (also known as Vielfaltig) is required for this transition and for transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome.  Although the mechanisms driving this genome activation are currently unknown, the transcriptional activator Zelda (ZLD) has been shown to be instrumental in driving this process in Drosophila melanogaster.   Zelda potentiates morphogen activity by increasing chromatin accessibility.  Zelda (Zld) plays such a role in the Drosophila embryo, where it has been shown to control the action of patterning signals; however, the mechanisms underlying this effect remain largely unclear.  rthermore, a putative homologue of the Zelda gene has been considered, which in D.  melanogaster encodes a DNA-binding factor responsible for the maternal-to-zygotic transition. CO In the endopterygote Drosophila melanogaster, Zelda is an activator of the zygotic genome during the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT).

"[SOC]###context: Using this approach, large prospective studies have reported reductions in CVD risk ranging from 10 to 60% in groups whose diets can be variously classified as ‘Healthy’, ‘Prudent’, Mediterranean’ or ‘DASH compliant’.  Our findings suggest that a heart healthy dietary pattern is associated with moderately reduced risk of MI, but not related to risk of VTE.  The systematically reviewed studies reveal that a high adherence to a Mediterranean type of diet or ""prudent diet"" is associated with reduced risk of CVD and some types of cancer, even in the elderly.  In a large healthy Italian population, non-predefined dietary patterns including foods considered to be rather unhealthy, were associated with higher levels of cardiovascular risk factors, CRP and individual global CVD risk, whereas a ""prudent-healthy"" pattern was associated with lower levels.  We observed an inverse association between the prudent pattern and AMI, with higher levels being protective.  After multivariable adjustment, the prudent diet was associated with a 28% lower risk of cardiovascular mortality (95% confidence interval [CI], 13 to 40) and a 17% lower risk of all-cause mortality (95% CI, 10 to 24) when the highest quintile was compared with the lowest quintile.   Greater adherence to the prudent pattern may reduce the risk of cardiovascular and total mortality, whereas greater adherence to the Western pattern may increase the risk among initially healthy women.

"[SOC]###context: In the budding yeast, cohesin is loaded onto the chromosome during the late G1 phase, establishes sister chromatid cohesion concomitant with DNA replication, and dissociates by the telophase.   Sister chromatid cohesion is mediated by cohesin, but the process of cohesion establishment during S-phase is still enigmatic.  Instead, we find that cohesin stability increases at the time of S-phase in a reaction that can be uncoupled from DNA replication.  By using ""single-copy"" derivatives of the 2-microm plasmid, we demonstrate that recruitment of cohesin at STB during S phase indeed translates into cohesion between plasmid molecules.  In cells recovering from nocodazole-induced spindle depolymerization and G(2)/M arrest, cohesin-STB association can be established coincident with spindle restoration.  This postreplication recruitment of cohesin is not functional in equipartitioning.   We have used chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray analysis (ChIP chip) to produce a genome-wide description of cohesin binding to meiotic and mitotic chromosomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  Cohesin sites are highly conserved in meiosis and mitosis, suggesting that chromosomes share a common underlying structure during different developmental programs.  Cohesin complex acts in the formation and maintenance of sister chromatid cohesion during and after S phase.   Proteolytic cleavage of cohesin's Sccl subunit at the metaphase to anaphase transition is essential for sister chromatid separation and depends on a conserved protein called separin.  Four of these proteins, Scc1p, Scc3p, Smc1p, and Smc3p, are subunits of a 'Cohesin' complex that binds chromosomes from late G1 until the onset of anaphase.  It is necessary for the establishment of cohesion during DNA replication but not for its maintenance during G2 and M phases.  Here, we show that cohesin destruction in metaphase is sufficient for segregation of much of the budding yeast genome, but not of the long arm of chromosome XII that contains the rDNA repeats.  In this review, we have discussed the life cycle of cohesin during both mitotic and meiotic cell divisions including the structure and architecture of cohesin complex, relevance of cohesin associated proteins, mechanism of cohesin loading onto the chromatin, cohesion establishment and the mechanism of cohesin disassembly during anaphase to separate the sister chromatids.  Cohesin association with G1 chromosomes requires continued activity of the cohesin loader Mis4/Ssl3, suggesting that repeated loading cycles maintain cohesin binding.  Cdc14 phosphatase induces rDNA condensation and resolves cohesin-independent cohesion during budding yeast anaphase.  Cohesins are deposited by a conserved heterodimeric loading complex composed of the Scc2 and Scc4 proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but how the Scc2/Scc4 deposition complex regulates the spatiotemporal association of cohesin with chromosomes is not understood.  We examined Scc2 chromatin association during the cell division cycle and found that the affinity of Scc2 for chromatin increases biphasically during the cell cycle, increasing first transiently in late G1 phase and then again later in G2/M.

"[SOC]###context: In this review we assess our currently available knowledge about reflex seizures with special emphasis on the difference between ""generalized"" reflex seizures induced by visual stimuli, thinking, praxis and language tasks, and ""focal"" seizures induced by startle, eating, music, hot water, somatosensory stimuli and orgasm.  CONCLUSIONS: Intermittent clobazam prophylaxis prior to head water bath might be a preferred mode of treatment of pure HWE.   Different types of reflex epilepsy such as eating, startle myoclonus, and hot water epilepsy were included in the study.   Hot water epilepsy was triggered by contact with hot water either in the bath or by hand immersion, and VEEG showed fronto-parietal involvement.  Hot water epilepsy is rarely described in European countries, where bathing epilepsy in younger children is more common and often confused with this type of epilepsy.  We studied the anatomical correlates of reflex hot water epilepsy (HWE) using multimodality investigations viz.  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).   The clinical and SPECT studies suggested temporal lobe as the seizure onset zone in some of the patients with HWE.  Hot water epilepsy (HWE) refers to a specific type of reflex epilepsy precipitated by the stimulus of bathing in hot water.  Pathogenesis is still unknown and temporal lobe has been thought to take part in the epileptogenesis.  HWE can be symptomatic of focal cortical malformation, and few cases were reported.

The diagnosis of hot water epilepsy was supported by an ictal EEG.  Hot water epilepsy, also known as bathing epilepsy or water-immersion epilepsy is, in the Caucasian population, a rare form of benign epilepsy, where seizures are provoked by immersion in a hot or even just a warm bath.  This is the first comprehensive video publication of a seizure provoked by water-immersion in a Caucasian child.   Hot water epilepsy (HWE) is a form of reflex or sensory epilepsy wherein seizures are precipitated by an unusual stimulus, the contact of hot water over the head and body.   Hot water epilepsy (HWE) is a rare form of reflex epilepsy caused by bathing with hot water.  In this paper, we describe three cases with hot water epilepsy.  &quot;Hot water epilepsy&quot; (HWE), precipitated by a bath or shower in hot water, has been described infrequently in the literature.  A video-EEG recording was taken while hot water was poured onto his chest.  Hot water epilepsy is rarely described in European countries, where bathing epilepsy in younger children is more common and often confused with this type of epilepsy.  Hot water epilepsy (HWE) or bathing epilepsy is one of the reflex epilepsies induced by hot water pouring over the head, These two patients are the youngest reported cases of reflex hot water seizures, and the only reported cases in which reflex hot water seizures subsequently manifested episodes of alternating hemiplegia.  Hot water epilepsy is a reflex epilepsy.  Seizures are provoked by hot water, and result from the association of both cutaneous and heat stimuli.  Hot water epilepsy belongs to the group of reflex epilepsies.  Seizures are provoked by hot water, due to the association of both cutaneous and heat stimuli.  A patient with reflex epilepsy is described, in whom seizures were induced by bathing in hot water.

"[SOC]###context: We then performed a chemical screen and identified several small molecules that increase or reduce cardiomyocyte proliferation during heart development.  These compounds act via Hedgehog, Insulin-like growth factor or Transforming growth factor β signaling pathways.   Here, we report that the balance between the reparative and regenerative processes is achieved through Smad3-dependent TGFβ signaling.   Thus, TGFβ signaling orchestrates the beneficial interplay between scar-based repair and cardiomyocyte-based regeneration to achieve complete heart regeneration.  As expected, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, a profibrotic cytokine, was dramatically upregulated in MI hearts, but its phosphorylated comediator (pSmad) was significantly downregulated in the nuclei of Cx43-deficient hearts post-MI, suggesting that downstream signaling of TGF-beta is diminished substantially in Cx43-deficient hearts.  This diminution in profibrotic TGF-beta signaling resulted in the attenuation of adverse structural remodeling as assessed by echocardiography.  Potentially beneficial changes include increases in the HSMP secretory-leucocyte-protease-inhibitor (SLPI) and cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta(1).  Targeting these proteins may mitigate enhanced LV remodeling and dysfunction with aging.  After injury, the presence of macrophages, which secreted high levels of transforming growth factor-beta and vascular endothelial growth factor-A, led to rapid removal of cell debris and replacement by granulation tissue containing inflammatory cells and blood vessels, followed by myofibroblast infiltration and collagen deposition.  Secretion of transforming growth factor-beta and vascular endothelial growth factor-A as well as neovascularization, myofibroblast infiltration, and collagen deposition decreased.   Repression of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine synthesis, mediated in part through Transforming Growth Factor (TGF)-beta and Interleukin (IL)-10, is critical for resolution of the inflammatory infiltrate and transition to fibrous tissue deposition.  TGF-beta conducted the myogenic differentiation of CD117+ stem cells by upregulating GATA-4 and NKx-2. 5 expression.  Therefore, the intramyocardial implantation of TGF-beta-preprogrammed CD117+ cells effectively assisted the myocardial regeneration and induced therapeutic angiogenesis, contributing to functional cardiac regeneration.  These results indicate that TGF-beta/Smad signaling may be involved in the remodeling of the infarct scar after the completion of wound healing per se, via ongoing stimulation of matrix deposition.

"[SOC]###context: We describe a unique case of a 23-yr-old female patient affected by a homozygous loss of function mutation in the L-ferritin gene, idiopathic generalized seizures, and atypical restless leg syndrome (RLS).  We show that L chain ferritin is undetectable in primary fibroblasts from the patient, and thus ferritin consists only of H chains.  Our results demonstrate for the first time the pathophysiological consequences of L-ferritin deficiency in a human and help to define the concept for a new disease entity hallmarked by idiopathic generalized seizure and atypical RLS.  These results when viewed along with prior RLS SPECT and autopsy studies of DAT, and cell culture studies with iron deficiency and DAT, suggest that membrane-bound striatal DAT, but not total cellular DAT, may be decreased in RLS.   Compared with the PD or healthy group, the level of serum ferritin and the H-reflex latency of tibial nerve were significantly decreased in PD with RLS group (P < 0. 05).  Deficiency of iron and decreased inhibition function of spinal cord may lead to the occurrence of RLS in PD patients.   Association of iron deficiency with febrile seizures, pica, breath holding spells, restless leg syndrome and thrombosis is increasingly being recognized.   Iron status was generally poor among regular blood donors, especially in women, with a high incidence of iron depletion (>20%) and RLS (18%).   Iron status is poor in regular blood donors, restless legs syndrome is common, and the routine iron supplementation is insufficient.   Furthermore, there appears to be an association between iron deficiency and those suffering from Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS).   The authors propose that PPIs, such as omeprazole, may interfere with iron absorption in certain patients and that a subpopulation of patients who develop significant iron deficiency characterized by low serum ferritin levels while on PPIs may also develop RLS-like symptoms (including RLSAP).  Clinical studies have implicated the dopaminergic system in RLS, while others have suggested that it is associated with insufficient levels of brain iron.   The results are consistent with the hypothesis that a primary iron insufficiency produces a dopaminergic abnormality characterized as an overly activated dopaminergic system as part of the RLS pathology.  RLS may also be secondary to a number of conditions including iron deficiency, pregnancy and end-stage renal failure and, perhaps, neuropathy.  The pathogenesis of RLS probably involves the interplay of systemic or brain iron deficiency and impaired dopaminergic neurotransmission in the subcortex of the brain.   All patients showed low levels of ferritin and iron supplementation was effective in five cases.   Clinical and animal studies that support the benefits of iron supplementation, independent of increasing hemoglobin, such as those on immune function, physical performance, thermoregulation, cognition, and restless leg syndrome and aluminum absorption is the subject of this narrative review.  Restless leg syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) are considered to be a continuum of a neurological sleep disorder associated with abnormal iron metabolism or deficiency.  I describe a case of RLS and PLMD in a cystic fibrosis patient with iron deficiency from chronic hemoptysis.  This is the first case that reports RLS and PLMD manifesting from iron deficiency caused by chronic hemoptysis in advanced cystic fibrosis lung disease.  Restless leg syndrome manifested by iron deficiency from chronic hemoptysis in cystic fibrosis.  Diurnal effects on motor control are evident in the human disease of Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS), which is purported to be linked to brain iron deficiency as well as alterations in dopaminergic systems.   Iron deficiency in the central nervous system is known to cause motor impairment and cognitive deficits; more recently, it has been suggested that it may play a role in the pathophysiology of the restless leg syndrome.   Restless leg syndrome (RLS), aging, pregnancy, uraemia, iron deficiency, polyneuropathy are some of the common causes of secondary PLMD.  The syndrome is increasingly often diagnosed, particularly in association with iron deficiency, during pregnancy, in chronic renal failure and in patients with peripheral neuropathy.   Clinical, EEG, electromyographic and polysomnographic studies in restless legs syndrome caused by magnesium deficiency.  A frequent polymorphism in BTBD9 was significantly associated with serum ferritin.  This polymorphism has previously been associated with RLS, but not low iron stores in blood donors.

Recent studies have shown that relaxin prevents and reverses cardiac fibrosis.  Endogenous expression of relaxin was elevated in the setting of heart disease; the extent of such up-regulation, however, is insufficient to exert compensatory actions, and the mechanism regulating relaxin expression is poorly defined.  In the rat relaxin-1 (RLN1, Chr1) gene promoter region we found presence of repeated guanine (G)-rich sequences, which allowed formation and stabilization of G-quadruplexes with the addition of a G-quadruplex interactive ligand berberine.  Up-regulating relaxin expression by G-quadruplex interactive ligand to achieve antifibrotic action Our findings document a novel therapeutic strategy for fibrosis through up-regulating expression of endogenous relaxin.

"[SOC]###context: BACKGROUND: Patients with crowned dens syndrome (CDS), which is pseudogout of the atlantoaxial junction induced by ""crown-like"" calcifications around the dens, present with symptoms of severe neck pain, rigidity, and high fever.   BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Crowned dens syndrome (CDS) is a rare form of calcium phosphate crystal depositions and often presents with recurrent neck pain, stiffness of neck, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and episodes of fever.  A CT scan revealed calcification of the transverse ligament and crown-like calcification around the odontoid process.  According to the clinical and radiological findings, she was diagnosed with crowned dens syndrome (CDS).  Crystal deposition in the cervical spine around the odontoid process may lead to acute neck pain.  This rare condition is called crowned dens syndrome and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a possible etiology for fever, headache and cervical pain of unknown origin.   Crowned dens syndrome (CDS), related to microcrystalline deposition in the periodontoid process, is the main cause of acute or chronic cervical pain.  Axial calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease (CPDD) is well known for cervical spine involvement with the crowned dens syndrome but other localisations are probably underdiagnosed in sterile spondylodiscitis.   We describe a patient with crowned dens syndrome which manifested with clinical (acute occipital headache) and radiographic (calcium deposits in the alar ligament) features.  FDG uptake in the immediate vicinity of the odontoid process, with a crownlike calcification, was identified on the CT scan on the posterior side of the dens, thus confirming the diagnosis of crowned dens syndrome.  We describe a patient with crowned dens syndrome which manifested with clinical (acute occipital headache) and radiographic (calcium deposits in the alar ligament) features Crowned dens syndrome (CDS), related to microcrystalline deposition in the periodontoid process, is the main cause of acute or chronic cervical pain. This report describes the case of an 87-year-old woman who had severe bradykinesia, muscle rigidity, gait disturbance and neck pain The crowned dens syndrome, related to microcrystalline deposition in the peri-odontoid articular and abarticular structures, is mainly responsible for acute or chronic cervical pain. We report eight cases of crowned dens syndrome with atypical presentations mimicking giant cell arteritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, meningitis or discitis The crowned dens syndrome as a cause of neck pain: clinical and computed tomography study in patients with calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease Computed tomography of the cervical spine demonstrated linear calcific deposits in the transverse ligament of atlas (crowned dens syndrome) in all patients.  Crystals located in the transverse ligament of the atlas give rise to the crowned dens syndrome, usually in patients affected by severe degenerative lesions of the atlantoaxial joint and peripheral chondrocalcinosis.  BACKGROUND: Patients with crowned dens syndrome typically present with severe neck pain and have calcium deposits around the odontoid process of the axis on radiographs.  We describe a patient with crowned dens syndrome which manifested with clinical (acute occipital headache) and radiographic (calcium deposits in the alar ligament) features.

"[SOC]###context: Treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer with targeted anti-EGFR therapeutics such as cetuximab extends survival in only 25% of patients who test wild-type for KRAS, while the majority of patients prove resistant (J Clin Oncol 28(7):1254-1261, 2010).  .  Somatic mutation of the EGFR signalling pathway is a prevalent mechanism of resistance to cetuximab (Nature 486(7404):532-536, 2012).  If the human genome harbours variants that influence susceptibility of the EGFR pathway to oncogenic mutation, such variants could also be prognostic for cetuximab responsiveness.   KRAS mutations are strong predictors for clinical outcomes of EGFR-targeted treatments such as cetuximab and panitumumab in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).  KRAS mutation is widely accepted as a strong, negative predictive marker for anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies, including cetuximab and panitumumab.   KRAS status is now a mandatory prerequisite in order to treat metastatic colorectal patients with anti-Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) antibodies, such as cetuximab or panitumumab.  KRAS mutations are unambiguously linked to a lack of response to these targeted therapies.  The EGFR-R497K polymorphism is a potential predictor for overall survival in HNSCC patients treated with cetuximab based therapy in the palliative setting.  Laboratories are increasingly required to perform molecular tests for the detection of mutations in the KRAS gene in metastatic colorectal cancers to allow better clinical management and more effective treatment for these patients.  KRAS mutation status predicts a patient's likely response to the monoclonal antibody cetuximab.  KRAS mutation has been unambiguously identified as a marker of resistance to cetuximab-based treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients.    This study suggested EGF A+61G polymorphism to be a predictive marker for pCR, independent of KRAS mutation status, to cetuximab-based neoadjuvant chemoradiation of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.  Intratumoral gene expression levels of EGFR, VEGFR2 and NRP as well as polymorphisms in FCGR3A, CyclinD1 and EGFR could predict clinical outcome in mCRC patients enrolled in BOND2, independent of KRAS mutation status.  Numerous clinical studies have shown that anti-EGFR therapies are effective only in a subset of patients with colorectal cancer.  Even though mutations in the KRAS gene have been confirmed as negative predictors of the response to EGFR-targeted therapies, not all KRAS wild-type (wt-KRAS) patients will respond to treatment.  Recent studies have demonstrated that additionally wild-type BRAF (wt-BRAF) genotype is required for response to panitumumab or cetuximab, suggesting that BRAF genotype criteria should be used together with KRAS genotype for selecting the patients who are about to benefit from the anti-EGFR therapy.  KRAS mutation is a dramatic example of single nucleotide polymorphism, which is able to identify a priori patients that could receive or not an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody such as cetuximab or panitumumab.   While confirming the negative effect of KRAS mutations on outcome after cetuximab, we show that BRAF, NRAS, and PIK3CA exon 20 mutations are significantly associated with a low response rate.  Cetuximab and panitumumab, mAbs targeting EGFR, are registered for metastatic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC) patients whose tumors express EGFR as determined by immunohistochemistry.  However, this method is not predictive of treatment efficacy.  .  This study suggests that TP53 mutations are predictive of cetuximab sensitivity, particularly in patients without KRAS mutation, and that TP53 genotyping could have a clinical interest to select patients who should benefit from cetuximab-based CT.  A KRAS mutation confers resistance to cetuximab, which reduces treatment options, especially in first-line.   KRAS genotyping was recently introduced as predictive biomarker, since only tumors carrying a wildtype were found to respond to treatment with panitumumab.

"[SOC]###context: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the commonest arrhythmia in clinical practice and is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a common breathing disorder, is an independent risk factor for AF.  There is a growing consensus in the scientific community that suggests a strong association between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and cardiovascular (CVD) conditions and events, including coronary artery disease, hypertension, arrhythmia, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death.   part from well-established risk factors that increase the odds for the development of AF, e. g.  age or arterial hypertension, recent analyses indicate that obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) may independently, negatively modify the arrhythmia occur-rence profile.   Evidence supports a causal association of sleep apnea with the incidence and morbidity of hypertension, coronary heart disease, arrhythmia, heart failure, and stroke.  Severe snoring may be associated with pulmonary and systemic hypertension, secondary polycythemia, and cardiac arrhythmias. <br> Severe snoring may be associated with pulmonary and systemic hypertension, secondary polycythemia, and cardiac arrhythmias.  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias occur in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), reportedly as a consequence of the autonomic effects of recurrent apnea with subsequent oxygen desaturation.  Obstructive apnea is associated with myocardial ischemia (silent or symptomatic), acute coronary events, stroke and transient ischemic attacks, cardiac arrhythmia, pulmonary hypertension and heart failure.  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common form of sleep-disordered breathing, affecting 5-15% of the population.  It is characterized by intermittent episodes of partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway during sleep that disrupts normal ventilation and sleep architecture, and is typically associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring, and witnessed apneas.  Patients with obstructive sleep apnea present risk to the general public safety by causing 8-fold increase in vehicle accidents, and they may themselves also suffer from the physiologic consequences of OSA; these include hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmias Obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea with Cheyne-Stokes respiration                     are associated with an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmia.   Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects approximately 4% of middle-aged men and 2% of middle-aged women.  Cardiac arrhythmias are common problems in patients with OSA, even though the true prevalence and clinical relevance of cardiac arrhythmias remains to be determined.   Cardiac arrhythmias during wakefulness and sleep in 15 patients with sleep-induced obstructive apnea, and the effect of atropine and tracheostomy on these arrhythmias were studied by continuous overnight Holter electrocardiographic, respiratory and electroencephalographic recordings.  obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as its most extreme variant, is characterized by intermittent episodes of partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway, leading to cessation of breathing while asleep.  Cardiac arrhythmias are common problems in OSA patients, although the true prevalence and clinical relevance of cardiac arrhythmias remains to be determined The mechanisms associated with the cardiovascular consequences of obstructive sleep apnea include abrupt changes in autonomic tone, which can trigger cardiac arrhythmias.    Recent studies have shown that cardiac arrhythmias and conduction disorders are common in patients with SA.  Sleep apnea Severity of nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias correlates with intensity of sleep apnea in men Patients affected with OSA are frequently hypertensive and can have dangerous cardiac arrhythmias.  Patients with stable cardiac failure who snore may present sleep hypopnea and cardiac arrhythmias.    Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.  Cardiac arrhythmias are common in patients with OSA.   Nocturnal hypoxia has been associated with serious ventricular tachyarrhythmias as well as life-threatening bradyarrhythmias.  Obesity and snoring, both of which increase with age, have been identified as risk factors for sleep-related breathing disorders, as have hypertension and heart disease.  Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is associated with excess daytime sleepiness, depression, and an increased incidence of ischemic cardiopathy, cardiac arrhythmias, systemic hypertension and brain infarction.  We found 58 percent prevalence of arrhythmias in patients with sleep apnea (apnea/hypopnea index = AHI>10), vs 42 percent in nonapneic controls (chi 2 = 16. 7, p<0. 0001)

"[SOC]###context: Here we demonstrate that mRNAs containing ALREX-promoting elements are trafficked through nuclear speckles.  Finally, we demonstrate that mRNAs lacking a poly(A)-tail are not efficiently exported by the ALREX pathway and show enhanced association with nuclear speckles  In a previous study (Melcák et al. , 2001), it has been shown that the pre-spliceosomal assembly on microinjected splicing-competent precursor mRNA takes place in the speckles, and it has been suggested that the targeting of RNA into speckes consists of two interdependent steps, namely the diffusion process, followed by the energy-dependent translocation of RNA into the speckles.   Nuclear speckles, a unique nuclear subcompartment, accumulate a family of proteins, namely, serine- and arginine-rich (SR) proteins.  They play important roles in regulation of pre-mRNA splicing.    Here we show that C3G localizes to SC35-positive nuclear speckles and regulates splicing activity.  Our results identify C3G and Rap1 as novel components of nuclear speckles and a role for C3G in regulating cellular RNA splicing activity.  DNAJC17 is localized in nuclear speckles and interacts with splicing machinery components.  These results suggest that exosomal mRNA degradation mostly occurs outside of NSs.

"[SOC]###context: Over the past decade, MM therapy is significantly improved by the introduction of novel therapeutics such as immunomodulatory agents (thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide), proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib, carfilzomib, and ixazomib), monoclonal antibodies (daratumumab and elotuzumab), histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (Panobinostat).  Due to the largely incurable nature of multiple myeloma, the development of newer agents is ongoing and includes new oral PIs (ixazomib), immunotherapies (e. g. , CD38- or SLAMF7-targeted antibodies), and small molecules.   Ixazomib (MLN9708-MLN2238), the second-generation proteasome inhibitor, selectivity and potency were similar to that of bortezomib, is currently being investigated in phase I studies.  In the last few weeks, the FDA approved three new therapies for multiple myeloma: ixazomib, the first oral proteasome inhibitor; and daratumumab and elotuzumab, two monoclonal antibodies that target CD38 and SLAMF7, respectively.  Ixazomib, the first oral proteasome inhibitor to be evaluated in multiple myeloma, exerts substantial anti-myeloma activity as a single agent and particularly in combination with immunomodulatory drugs and it may be an attractive option for maintenance therapy.   Since the introduction of bortezomib in 2003, several next-generation proteasome inhibitors have also been used clinically, including carfilzomib, oprozomib, ixazomib, and delanzomib.

"[SOC]###context: Here we report that bioinformatic analyses suggested the presence in AtxA of two PTS (phosphenolpyruvate : sugar phosphotransferase system) regulation domains (PRD) generally regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation at conserved histidine residues.  Our results link virulence factor production in B.  anthracis to carbohydrate metabolism and, for the first time, provide a mechanistic explanation for AtxA transcriptional activity.  Upon infection of a mammalian host, Bacillus anthracis responds to host cues, and particularly to elevated temperature (37°C) and bicarbonate/CO2 concentrations, with increased expression of virulence factors that include the anthrax toxins and extracellular capsular layer.  The 475 amino acid sequence of AtxA reveals DNA binding motifs and regions similar to proteins associated with the phosphoenolpyruvate: carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS).   cultures grown with elevated CO(2) /bicarbonate exhibited increased AtxA dimer/monomer ratios and increased AtxA activity, relative to cultures grown without added CO(2) /bicarbonate, suggesting that this host-associated signal enhances AtxA function by shifting the dimer/monomer equilibrium towards the dimeric state.  Transcription of the major Bacillus anthracis virulence genes is triggered by CO2, a signal mimicking the host environment.   Furthermore, in vitro in presence of CO2 and in vivo, AtxA is part of the sap and eag regulatory network.   Regulation of anthrax toxin activator gene (atxA) expression in Bacillus anthracis: temperature, not CO2/bicarbonate, affects AtxA synthesis.   In atxA+ strains, expression of the toxin genes (pag, lef, and cya) is enhanced by two physiologically significant signals: elevated CO2/bicarbonate and temperature.   Our data indicate that atxA expression is not influenced by CO2/bicarbonate levels.  However, the steady-state level of atxA mRNA in cells grown in elevated CO2/bicarbonate at 37 degrees C is five- to sixfold higher than that observed in cells grown in the same conditions at 28 degrees C.   The Bacillus anthracis toxin genes, cya, lef, and pag, can be viewed as a regulon, in which transcription of all three genes is activated in trans by the same regulatory gene, atxA, in response to the same signal, CO2 CO2-enhanced toxin gene transcription is not observed in atx4-null mutants.  Comparison of the resulting protein patterns indicated that synthesis of non-toxin proteins is influenced by growth in elevated CO2 and the toxin gene regulator, atxA.   Transposon-insertion libraries were screened for mutants expressing CO2-enhanced atxA-dependent beta-galactosidase activity.  DNA sequence analysis of transposon insertion sites in 17 mutants carrying CO2- and atxA-regulated fusions revealed 10 mutants carrying independent insertions on the 185-kb toxin plasmid pXO1 which did not map to the toxin genes.   data indicate a clear association of atxA with CO2-enhanced gene expression in B.  anthracis and provide evidence that atxA regulates genes other than the structural genes for the anthrax toxin proteins.  Transcription initiated from P1 and P2 was activated by both atxA and acpA, and activation appeared to be stimulated by bicarbonate.  The anthrax toxin activator gene atxA is associated with CO2-enhanced non-toxin gene expression in Bacillus anthracis.  Transcriptome analysis identifies Bacillus anthracis genes that respond to CO2 through an AtxA-dependent mechanism Transcription initiated from P1 and P2 was activated by both atxA and acpA, and activation appeared to be stimulated by bicarbonate.   Transcriptome analysis identifies Bacillus anthracis genes that respond to CO2 through an AtxA-dependent mechanism.  Expression of the toxin genes by B.  anthracis is enhanced during growth under elevated levels of CO2.  This CO2 effect is observed only in the presence of another pXO1 gene, atxA, which encodes a transactivator of anthrax toxin synthesis.  Here we show that transcription of atxA does not appear to differ in cells grown in 5% CO2 compared with cells grown in air.  Transcription initiated from P1 and P2 was activated by both atxA and acpA, and activation appeared to be stimulated by bicarbonate.  Deletion analysis of the upstream region of the cap promoter revealed that activation by both atxA and acpA required a DNA segment of 70 bp extending upstream of the P1 site.  We identified two major apparent transcriptional start sites, designated P1 and P2, located at positions 731 bp and 625 bp, respectively, upstream of the translation-initiation codon of capB.  Transcription initiated from P1 and P2 was activated by both atxA and acpA, and activation appeared to be stimulated by bicarbonate.

"[SOC]###context: Researchers working in multiple model organisms - notably yeast, insects and mammalian cells - have shown that pre-mRNA can be spliced during the process of transcription (i. e.  co-transcriptionally), as well as after transcription termination (i. e.  post-transcriptionally) The consensus view, based on four organisms, is that the majority of splicing events take place co-transcriptionally in most cells and tissues.  Deep sequencing of subcellular RNA fractions shows splicing to be predominantly co-transcriptional We show that in the human genome, splicing occurs predominantly during transcription.  Consistent with co-transcriptional spliceosome assembly and splicing, we have found significant enrichment of spliceosomal snRNAs in chromatin-associated RNA compared with other cellular RNA fractions and other nonspliceosomal snRNAs.   The majority of introns in higher eukaryotes are excised prior to transcript release in a manner that is dependent on transcription through pol II s a result of co-transcriptional splicing, variations in pol II elongation influence alternative splicing patterns, wherein a slower elongation rate is associated with increased inclusion of alternative exons within mature mRNA.   We show that the pattern of intronic sequence read coverage is explained by nascent transcription in combination with co-transcriptional splicing Modelling reveals co-transcriptional splicing to be the most probable and most efficient splicing pathway for the reporter transcripts, due in part to a positive feedback mechanism for co-transcriptional second step splicing RNA processing events that take place on the transcribed pre-mRNA include capping, splicing, editing, 3' processing, and polyadenylation.  Most of these processes occur co-transcriptionally while the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) enzyme is engaged in transcriptional elongation Abundant evidence indicates that splicing to excise introns occurs co-transcriptionally, prior to release of the nascent transcript from RNAP II Together, our work establishes a system for co-transcriptional splicing in vitro, in which the spliceosome containing the 5' and 3' exons are tethered to RNAP II for splicing.  Co-transcriptional splicing of constitutive and alternative exons Current evidence supports co-transcriptional spliceosomal assembly, but there is little quantitative information on how much splicing is completed during RNA synthesis Thus, we demonstrate that the decision to include or skip an alternative exon is made during transcription and not post-transcriptionally Here, we demonstrated that the co-transcriptional splicing of the intron in vitro was blocked by antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) targeting the P3-P7 core of the intron RNA editing and alternative splicing: the importance of co-transcriptional coordination Co-transcriptional splicing of pre-messenger RNAs: considerations for the mechanism of alternative splicing The realization that splicing occurs co-transcriptionally requires two important considerations

"[SOC]###context: ndependent research, often in the context of muscle biology, described Tead (TEA domain) transcription factors, which bind CATTCC DNA motifs to regulate gene expression.  These two research areas were joined by the finding that the Hippo pathway regulates the activity of Tead transcription factors mainly through phosphorylation of the transcriptional coactivators Yap and Taz, which bind to and activate Teads.  TEADs on their own are unable to activate transcription and they require the help of coactivators.  Several TEAD-interacting coactivators are known and they can be classified into three groups: (1) YAP and its paralog TAZ; YAP and TAZ are transcription coactivators and effectors of the Hippo pathway, which play a key role in organ size control.  Through interaction with transcription factors such as TEADs, they activate gene transcription and thus promote cell proliferation, inhibit apoptosis, and regulate cell differentiation.

"[SOC]###context: Sphincter of Oddi (SO) is a dynamic structure located strategically at the confluence of the bile duct, the pancreatic duct and the duodenum.   Because the sphincter of Oddi does not regulate the pancreaticobiliary junction in PBM, pancreatic juice frequently refluxes into the biliary tract and can cause various complications, including biliary cancer.   The most common functional disorders of the biliary tract and pancreas are associated with disordered motility of the sphincter of Oddi (SO).  Th We have investigated the existence of neural connections between the duodenum and the sphincter of Oddi (SO).  St nd set of experiments, sphincter of Oddi was divided into two parts and the effects of field stimulation were studied separately on areas close to the duodenal papilla (area I) and areas close to the common bile duct (area II).  In the whole sph morphine administered prior to MR cholangiopancreatography can improve image quality by causing the sphincter of Oddi to contract, which increases pressure in and distention of the biliary and pancreatic ducts.  Morphine admin LTS: Two to 3 weeks after gallbladder injection, labeled nerve cell bodies were found in the myenteric plexus of the proximal duodenum but were rare in the duodenum distal to the sphincter of Oddi.  No The sphincter of Oddi is the smooth muscle connection between the bile duct and the duodenum.  The Sphincter of Oddi is a small smooth muscle sphincter strategically placed at the junction of the bile duct, pancreatic duct, and duodenum.  The relationship of the sphincter of Oddi to the stomach, duodenum and gall-bladder.  There is a definite relationship between gastric antral activity and flow through the sphincter of Oddi.  The sphincter of Oddi appears to be partially autonomous but is readily affected by changes in duodenal tone. 2.  Mechanical or electrical stimulation of the stomach, duodenum, or upper small bowel influences the tone of the sphincter of Oddi.  Two thirds of patients with biliary sphincter of Oddi dysfunction have elevated pancreatic basal sphincter pressure.  Major papilla pancreatic sphincter dysfunction, a variant of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, causes pancreatitis and pancreatic-type pain.  Biliary and pancreatic endoscopic sphincterotomies are associated with two- to fourfold increased incidence of pancreatitis following the procedure in patients with pancreatic sphincter hypertension.  It has been reported that interdigestive motor activities occur in the gallbladder and sphincter of Oddi as well as in the gastroduodenal tract and truncal vagus nerves modulate the gastroduodenal motility pattern.  The results imply that celiac branches of the vagus nerve modulate the interdigestive motor activity in the stomach, descending duodenum, gallbladder and sphincter of Oddi.  The sphincter of Oddi is a small sphincter which is strategically placed at the junction of the bile duct and pancreatic duct with the duodenum.  [Lesions of the area of Oddi's sphincter: incidence and association with biliary and pancreatic lesions in a series of 109 autopsies].  These studies support Oddi's original description that the sphincter has a major role in the control of flow of bile and pancreatic juice into the duodenum, and equally importantly helps prevent the reflux of duodenal contents into the biliary and pancreatic ductal systems.  We have used the term sphincter of Oddi dysfunction to define manometric abnormalities in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with a biliary or pancreatic ductal origin.  Chronic pancreatitis was more frequently associated with an abnormal sphincter of Oddi, but in these cases, another associated disease could explain pancreatitis (alcoholism, hemochromatosis).

"[SOC]###context: The von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1) gene has been localized to the pericentromeric region of chromosome 17.  Nine markers from the pericentromeric region of chromosome 17 were typed in 16 British and five South African families with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).  Inspection of recombinant events in families informative for several markers suggests that the NF1 gene is located between the markers EW301 (cen-p11. 2) and EW206 (cen-q12) and possibly distal to pHHH202 (q11. 2-q12).  The gene for von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) has recently been mapped to the pericentromeric region of human chromosome 17.  In addition to reporting, in accompanying papers, their individual analyses of mapping the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene on chromosome 17, members of the International Consortium for NF1 Linkage contributed their data for our joint analysis to determine the exact sequence of flanking markers and to obtain precise estimates and confidence limits of the recombination fractions for the closest markers, in anticipation of clinical use.  To better map the location of the von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (NF1) gene, we have characterized a somatic cell hybrid designated 7AE-11.  This microcell-mediated, chromosome-transfer construct harbors a centromeric segment and a neo-marked segment from the distal long arm of human chromosome 17.  The cosmids in the NF1 region will be an important resource for testing DNA blots of large-fragment restriction-enzyme digests from NF1 patient cell lines, to detect rearrangements in patients' DNA and to identify the 17;22 NF1 translocation breakpoint.  The frequent LOH surrounding the NF1 locus and lack of neurofibromin expression in these tumors suggest that NF1 gene mutations may contribute to the development of adrenal gland neoplasms in patients with NF1.  In the latter, the breakpoint in 17q occurred below the centromere and is at or in the region of the Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) gene.  Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is an autosomal dominant condition associated with mutations in the long arm of chromosome 17, and characterised by neurofibromas, café-au-lait spots and axillary freckling.  In addition, the mother's and maternal grandmother's genetic analysis showed identical mutations in the neurofibromatosis I gene on the long arm of chromosome 17, confirming the diagnosis of NF1.  Duplicon-mediated microdeletions around the NF1 gene are frequently associated with a severe form of neurofibromatosis type I in a subgroup of patients who show an earlier onset of cutaneous neurofibromas, dysmorphic facial features, and lower IQ values.  Neurofibromatosis had been diagnosed in infancy, and genetic testing showed that the patient had a mutation in chromosome 17, consistent with neurofibromatosis type I.  Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common inherited diseases in humans.  It is caused by a mutation in the NF1 gene on chromosome 17, and is associated with numerous central and peripheral nervous system manifestations.  In 95% of NF1 individuals, a mutation is found in the NF1 gene, and in 5% of the patients, the germline mutation consists of a microdeletion that includes the NF1 gene and several flanking genes.  Herein, we describe a unique case of anaplastic de novo astroblastoma-sarcoma, in essence a variant of gliosarcoma, occurring in a 50-year-old female with documented NF1.  Genetic study (fluorescence in situ hybridization) demonstrated no chromosomal losses or gains.  Testing for abnormalities of chromosomes 7, 9, 10, 12, 17, 19 and 20, including the EGFR, p16, PTEN, MDM2 and NF1 gene regions, we found the tumor to exhibit a deletion of PTEN, monosomy 17 and gains of chromosomes 19 and 20q.  Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder affecting 1 in 3000 people.  The NF1 gene is located on chromosome 17q11. 2, spans 350 kb of genomic DNA, and contains 60 exons.  A patient with recurrent-remittent multiple sclerosis associated with neurofibromatosis type I is described.  The case is interesting for two reasons: 1) the difficulty of evaluating MRI findings, since both entities involve similar anomalies and 2) the relation between the two entities, according to evidence from recent genetic studies showing that the myelin protein gene associated to oligodendrocytes is part of an intron of the neurofibromatosis-1 gene of chromosome 17.  Neurofibromatosis type I (NFI) is a common autosomal dominant disorder with an increased risk for developing benign and malignant tumors.  The NFI gene has been cloned and maps to 17q11. 2, and the gene product acts as a tumor suppressor gene.  Direct sequencing of the NF1 gene in tumor DNA identified the presence of an inactivating NF1 somatic mutation in 41% (25/61) of analyzed sporadic tumors, associated with loss of the wild-type allele in 84% (21/25) of cases.  A novel mutation c. 4821delA was identified in NF1 gene, which predicted truncation of neurofibromin (p. Leu1607fs).  She had a genotype of heterozygous c. 6709C>T mutation of NF1 gene.  RESULTS: The mutational analysis of the NF1 gene revealed a novel frameshift insertion mutation in exon 4c (c. 654 ins A) in all affected family members.  Using lymphoblastoid, fibroblast, and buccal cell samples collected from both twins and from other family members in three generations, we discovered a pathogenic nonsense mutation in exon 40 of the NF1 gene.  We also found a novel non-synonymous change in exon 16 of the NF1 gene that was transmitted from the unaffected mother to both twins and co-segregated with the pathogenic mutation in the ensuing generation.  The disease gene of the Chinese NF1 family was linked to NF1 locus, and a nonsense mutation, G1336X in the NF1 gene was identified.  The present study demonstrated that G1336X mutation in the NF1 gene cause Neurofibromatosis type I in the family. 
###question: Mutation of which gene and which chromosome cause Neurofibromatosis type I?[EOC] [SOR]###response: Neurofibromatosis Type I is an autosomal dominant condition associated with NF-1 gene mutation that is located in the long arm of chromosome 17 (17q11. 2).  In the majority (95%) of Neurofibromatosis Type I individuals, the mutation is found in the NF1 gene, while the remaining 5% of the patients have different types of genetic abnormalities.  [EOR]"
"[SOC]###context: Long-term safety and efficacy of teriflunomide: Nine-year follow-up of the randomized TEMSO study.  OBJECTIVE: To report safety and efficacy outcomes from up to 9 years of treatment with teriflunomide in an extension (NCT00803049) of the pivotal phase 3 Teriflunomide Multiple Sclerosis Oral (TEMSO) trial (NCT00134563).  CONCLUSIONS: In the TEMSO extension, safety observations were consistent with the core trial, with no new or unexpected AEs in patients receiving teriflunomide for up to 9 years.  Teriflunomide, approved on the basis of the two placebo-controlled trials TEMSO and TOWER, demonstrated a reduction in the ARR from 0. 54 to 0. 37 and from 0. 50 to 0. 32 respectively.   Using data from pivotal studies of DMF (DEFINE, NCT00420212; CONFIRM, NCT00451451), fingolimod (FREEDOMS, NCT00289978; FREEDOMS II, NCT00355134), and teriflunomide (TEMSO, NCT00134563; TOWER, NCT00751881), we calculated NNTs to prevent any relapse, more severe relapses (such as those leading to hospitalization or requiring intravenous corticosteroids), and disability worsening.

In the TEMSO and TOWER studies, the 14-mg dose of teriflunomide significantly reduced annualized relapse rate (31% and 36% relative risk reduction compared with placebo, respectively; both P<0. 001) and risk of disability progression sustained for 12 weeks (hazard ratio vs placebo 0. 70 and 0. 69, respectively; both P<0. 05).  Teriflunomide treatment was also associated with significant efficacy on MRI measures of disease activity in TEMSO; both doses significantly reduced total lesion volume and number of gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions.

"[SOC]###context: Our results further substantiate that gene scanning of all relevant RET exons is a powerful tool in the management of MEN2 patients, We identified RET mutations in seven of 13 MTCs: five RET-positive cases revealed a mutation in exon 16 (M918T) and two a mutation in exon 10 (C618S and C620S).  In four of the RET-positive cases, the mutation was inherited, out of which three were reportedly associated with a multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) syndrome, i. e.  MEN2A (C618S), MEN2A/familial MTC (FMTC) (C620S), and MEN2B (M918T).  RET gene mutation carries a risk of MEN2 and MTC in all ethnic groups in South Africa Mutational screening of the RET gene identified a common mutation (C618R) in all 8 (7 FMTC and 1 MEN2A) Gene mutation in the RET-620 position carries significant risk and may be part of a targeted investigation of high-risk areas in HSCR Activating germline RET mutations are presented in patients with familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) and multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) types 2A and 2B, whereas inactivating germline mutations in patients with Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR).  The aim of this study was to evaluate genotype-phenotype correlations of the frequently discussed Tyr791Phe mutation in exon 13 of the RET proto-oncogene.  Screening of three groups of patients was performed (276 families with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), 122 families with HSCR, and 29 patients with pheochromocytoma).  We found this mutation in 3 families with apparently sporadic MTC, 3 families with FMTC/MEN2, 1 patient with pheochromocytoma, and 3 families with HSCR.  Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) is an inherited, autosomal-dominant disorder caused by deleterious mutations within the RET protooncogene.  MEN2 RET mutations are mainly heterozygous, missense sequence changes found in RET exons 10, 11, and 13-16 Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) occurs both sporadically and in the context of autosomal dominantly inherited multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) syndromes: MEN2A, MEN2B, and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC), which are caused by activating germline mutations in the RET proto-oncogene.  The germline mutation was detected because of the systematic genetic screening of the RET proto-oncogene, which is useful for genetic counseling of potential risk of HSCR and MTC in other family members.  This family could be added to the small worldwide cohort of families with MEN2A/FMTC-HSCR.  Germline mutations of the ret protooncogene are the underlying cause of the MEN2 syndromes and a proportion of cases of HSCR.  In this report, we describe a new kindred in which the MEN2 and HSCR phenotypes are associated with a single C620S point mutation at one of the cysteine codons of the extracellular domain of the ret protooncogene.  Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) occurs both sporadically and in the autosomal dominantly inherited multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2 syndromes.  The distinction between true sporadic MTC and a new mutation familial case is important for future clinical management of both the patient and family.  The susceptibility gene for MEN 2 is the RET proto-oncogene.

Investigation of the effects of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of macitentan, a novel dual endothelin receptor antagonist, in healthy subjects.  Macitentan is a potent, orally active, non-peptide antagonist of endothelin receptors with tissue-targeting properties, currently undergoing clinical development for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.   Interaction profile of macitentan, a new non-selective endothelin-1 receptor antagonist, in vitro.  Macitentan is a new non-selective endothelin-1 receptor antagonist under development for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.   This article highlights how the introduction of new compounds such as macitentan, riociguat and selexipag, which act on the endothelin, nitric oxide and prostacyclin pathways, respectively, have the potential to further improve the prognosis for patients with PAH.  Dual ETRA/ETRB blockade with macitentan (or the combination of the ETRA and ETRB antagonists BQ123 and BQ788) did not enhance antitumor immune cell recruitment.   The novel ERA macitentan has recently concluded testing in a Phase III morbidity/mortality clinical trial in PAH patients.   Given that the newest PAH drugs include a receptor tyrosine kinase antagonist (imatinib), a soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator (riociguat), an oral analog of prostacyclin (selexipag), and a tissue targeting ERA (macitentan) determination of appropriate combinations for various etiologies and clinical stages is urgently required.   The discovery of N-[5-(4-bromophenyl)-6-[2-[(5-bromo-2-pyrimidinyl)oxy]ethoxy]-4-pyrimidinyl]-N'-propylsulfamide (Macitentan), an orally active, potent dual endothelin receptor antagonist.  Among these, compound 17 (macitentan, ACT-064992) emerged as particularly interesting as it is a potent inhibitor of ET(A) with significant affinity for the ET(B) receptor and shows excellent pharmacokinetic properties and high in vivo efficacy in hypertensive Dahl salt-sensitive rats.   Renal, retinal and cardiac changes in type 2 diabetes are attenuated by macitentan, a dual endothelin receptor antagonist.  Here we investigated the effects of macitentan, an orally-active, tissue-targeting dual ET receptor antagonist on chronic complications in type 2 diabetes.   Several specific therapeutic agents were developed for the medical management of PAH including prostanoids (epoprostenol, trepoprostenil, iloprost), endothelin receptor antagonists (bosentan, ambrisentan, macitentan soon available) and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil).   The aim of the present study is to evaluate the in vitro effect of macitentan, an orally active tissue-targeting dual endothelin receptor antagonist, and its major metabolite (ACT-132577) on alpha smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA) expression, evaluated on dermal fibroblasts from healthy subjects and on dermal fibroblasts from lesional and non-lesional skin from sclerodermic patients.   Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of macitentan, an endothelin receptor antagonist, in an ascending multiple-dose study in healthy subjects.  This multiple-ascending-dose study investigated safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics, of macitentan, a new endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) with sustained receptor binding and enhanced tissue penetration properties compared to other ERAs.  We assessed the efficacy of macitentan, a new dual endothelin-receptor antagonist, using a primary end point of morbidity and mortality in a long-term trial.

Macitentan is a novel dual endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) showing sustained receptor occupancy.   Macitentan (Opsumit®) is a novel dual endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) with sustained receptor binding properties developed by Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd.   Endothelin (ET)-1 influences pathological changes via two ET receptor subtypes (ETA and ETB), to which it binds with high affinity.   Macitentan was developed by modifying the structure of bosentan in the search for an optimal dual ERA with improved efficacy and tolerability compared with other ERAs.   Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of macitentan, a dual endothelin receptor antagonist, in humans.  Macitentan is a tissue-targeting, dual endothelin receptor antagonist, currently under phase 3 investigation in pulmonary arterial hypertension.   Antivascular therapy for multidrug-resistant ovarian tumors by macitentan, a dual endothelin receptor antagonist.  The nonselective endothelin type A and B receptor antagonists bosentan (100 nmol/L) and macitentan (30 nmol/L) alone relaxed endothelin-contracted rings by 30±5% and 24±3%, respectively.   Macitentan is a dual endothelin receptor antagonist under phase 3 investigation in pulmonary arterial hypertension.  This rise could largely be prevented with the endothelin receptor antagonist macitentan (ΔBP: 12. 3±1. 5 mm Hg) and only mildly with Tempol, a superoxide dismutase mimetic (ΔBP: 25. 9±2. 3 mm Hg).   Promising study results for the treatment of IPF were published for the triple tyrosine kinase inhibitor intedanib, other drugs such as the endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) macitentan are currently investigated in clinical trials.  To study the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and tolerability of rising single doses of macitentan, an endothelin receptor antagonist, in healthy male subjects.   Macitentan (ACT-064992), a tissue-targeting endothelin receptor antagonist, enhances therapeutic efficacy of paclitaxel by modulating survival pathways in orthotopic models of metastatic human ovarian cancer.  We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of the dual ETR antagonist, macitentan, on human ovarian cancer cells, SKOV3ip1 and IGROV1, growing orthotopically in nude mice.   Macitentan, a tissue-targeting endothelin receptor antagonist for the potential oral treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  Macitentan (ACT-064992), under development by Actelion Ltd in collaboration with Japanese licensee Nippon Shinyaku Co Ltd, is an orally active, non-peptide dual endothelin (ET)(A) and ET(B) receptor antagonist for the potential treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).   Macitentan, because of its ability to target the tissues and to block both ET(A) and ET(B) receptors, is emerging as a new agent to treat cardiovascular disorders associated with chronic tissue ET system activation.   Comparison of the dissolution and pharmacokinetic profiles of two galenical formulations of the endothelin receptor antagonist macitentan.  Macitentan (ACT-064992) is an orally active endothelin receptor antagonist.   Pharmacology of macitentan, an orally active tissue-targeting dual endothelin receptor antagonist.  Macitentan, also called Actelion-1 or ACT-064992 [N-[5-(4-bromophenyl)-6-(2-(5-bromopyrimidin-2-yloxy)ethoxy)-pyrimidin-4-yl]-N'-propylaminosulfonamide], is a new dual ET(A)/ET(B) endothelin (ET) receptor antagonist designed for tissue targeting.  Macitentan and its metabolite antagonized the specific binding of ET-1 on membranes of cells overexpressing ET(A) and ET(B) receptors and blunted ET-1-induced calcium mobilization in various natural cell lines, with inhibitory constants within the nanomolar range.  In functional assays, macitentan and ACT-132577 inhibited ET-1-induced contractions in isolated endothelium-denuded rat aorta (ET(A) receptors) and sarafotoxin S6c-induced contractions in isolated rat trachea (ET(B) receptors).   In conclusion, macitentan, by its tissue-targeting properties and dual antagonism of ET receptors, protects against end-organ damage in diabetes and improves survival in pulmonary hypertensive rats.

Such mechanisms may also render leukemia cells vulnerable to perturbations of transcriptional regulators, which includes small molecules targeting the coactivator protein BRD4.  Here we report that the epigenetic reader BRD4 and the methyltransferase G9a repress a TFEB/TFE3/MITF-independent transcriptional program that promotes autophagy and lysosome biogenesis Our recent study revealed that autophagy programs are transcriptionally suppressed by the BET family protein BRD4.  BRD4 is a newly characterized transcriptional regulator that represses autophagy and lysosomal function.  As a member of the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family, BRD4 (bromodomain containing 4) can bind to acetylated histones and transcription factors, and is also able to recruit various transcriptional regulators.  Taken together, the newly reported repressive role of BRD4 in autophagy adds to our understanding of how autophagy and lysosome functions are regulated at the transcriptional level.  The olfactory bromodomain‑containing protein 4 (BRD4) is a protein that recognizes and binds acetylated lysine.  It has been reported that the high expression of BRD4 is involved in the process of cardiac hypertrophy.

"[SOC]###context: Abstract Muenke is a fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR-3) associated syndrome, which was first described in late 1990s.   The syndrome is defined molecularly by a unique point mutation c. 749C>G in exon 7 of the FGFR3 gene which results to an amino acid substitution p. Pro250Arg of the protein product.   Muenke syndrome is an autosomal dominant craniosynostosis syndrome resulting from a defining point mutation in the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor3 (FGFR3) gene.   Muenke syndrome is caused by a single defining point mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene.  Muenke syndrome is characterized by various craniofacial deformities and is caused by an autosomal-dominant activating mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3(P250R)               ).  The Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene is found in patients with Muenke syndrome and is one of the most frequently encountered mutations in craniosynostosis syndromes.   The Muenke syndrome (MS) is characterized by unicoronal or bicoronal craniosynostosis, midfacial hypoplasia, ocular hypertelorism, and a variety of minor abnormalities associated with a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene.  Here, we report a familial case of MS in a female patient with a Pro250Arg mutation in exon 7 (IgII-IGIII linker domain) of the FGFR3 gene.    Fibroblasts from 10 individuals each with Apert syndrome (FGFR2 substitution S252W), Muenke syndrome (FGFR3 substitution P250R), Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (various mutations in TWIST1) and non-syndromic sagittal synostosis (no mutation detected) were cultured.  We report on a set of identical twins with a de novo C749G mutation in the FGFR3 gene codon 250 after a pregnancy complicated by prenatal exposure to Nortriptyline.  Mutations in the gene that encodes Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) are associated with Achondroplasia (MIM 100800), Hypochondroplasia (MIM 146000), Muenke Syndrome (MIM 602849), Thanatophoric Dysplasia (MIM 187600, MIM 187601) and Lacrimo-Auriculo-Dento-Digital Syndrome (MIM 149730).  The identification of the P250R mutation allowed the confirmation of the Muenke Syndrome in 9 out of the 52 cases referred.   Muenke syndrome, defined by heterozygosity for a Pro250Arg substitution in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), is the most common genetic cause of craniosynostosis in humans.  We have used gene targeting to introduce the Muenke syndrome mu Muenke syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by coronal suture craniosynostosis, hearing loss, developmental delay, carpal and tarsal fusions, and the presence of the Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene.   To better define the clinical features of this syndrome, we initiated a study of the natural history of Muenke syndrome.  To date, we have conducted a standardized evaluation of nine patients with a confirmed Pro250Arg mutation in FGFR3.   The patients were either placed into the ""Muenke"" group (n=11) or the ""non-Muenke"" control group (n=12) on the basis of a test for the P250R mutation in the FGFR3 gene.  P250R mutation in the FGFR3 gene also known as Muenke syndrome is associated with coronal craniosynostosis, sensorineural deafness, craniofacial, and digital abnormalities.  However, Muenke et al.  [(1997); Am J Hum Genet 91: 555-564] described a new subgroup carrying the Pro250Arg mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 3 gene on chromosome 4p16.  Muenke syndrome, also known as FGFR3-associated coronal synostosis, is defined molecularly by the presence of a heterozygous nucleotide transversion, c. 749C>G, encoding the amino acid substitution Pro250Arg, in the fibroblast growth factor receptor type 3 gene (FGFR3).   In spite of a variable phenotype, Muenke syndrome has been related to a unique mutation on the FGFR3 gene, Pro 250 to Arg, which is characteristic of this disease.   Hypochondroplasia (HCH) and Muenke syndrome (MS) are caused by mutations on FGFR3 gene.

Dupilumab was also introduced as a possible treatment for patients with severe pemphigus.  It can directly inhibit IL-4 by targeting IL-4 α-chain receptor.   OBJECTIVE: To assess inhibition of interleukins 4 and 13 with dupilumab in patients with chronic sinusitis and nasal polyposis.  BACKGROUND: Dupilumab, a fully human anti-interleukin-4 receptor α monoclonal antibody, inhibits interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 signalling, key drivers of type-2-mediated inflammation.   Anti-IL-4 and IL-13 agents (dupilumab, lebrikizumab, and tralokinumab) which block different Th-2 inflammatory pathways and agents targeting the Th-17 inflammatory pathway in severe refractory asthma are under development.  Best evidence of the clinical efficacy of novel immunologic approaches using biological agents in patients with AD is available for the anti-IL-4 receptor α-chain antibody dupilumab, but a number of studies are currently ongoing with other specific antagonists to immune system players.  Background Dupilumab, a human monoclonal antibody against interleukin-4 receptor alpha, inhibits signaling of interleukin-4 and interleukin-13, type 2 cytokines that may be important drivers of atopic or allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis.   The world's first prospective controlled studies with the biologic human anti-IL4R antibody dupilumab for the indication ""atopic dermatitis"" were published in 2014.  An IL-4R antagonist, dupilumab, is the first drug that shows great promise in phase II trials.   Dupilumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the interteukin-4R is the first antibody (i. e.  'biological') with published efficacy shown in controlled prospective studies in atopic dermatitis.   Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against the IL-4 receptor α subunit that blocks the signaling of IL-4 and IL-13, both key cytokines in Th2-mediated pathways.  Dupilumab inhibits interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) signaling and was previously found to be effective in asthma.  Data from early-stage studies suggested that interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 are requisite drivers of atopic dermatitis, evidenced by marked improvement after treatment with dupilumab, a fully-human monoclonal antibody that blocks both pathways.

Here we ask whether open chromatin profiling can be used to identify the entire repertoire of active promoters and enhancers underlying tissue-specific gene expression during normal development and oncogenesis in vivo.  To this end, we first compare two different approaches to detect open chromatin in vivo using the Drosophila eye primordium as a model system: FAIRE-seq, based on physical separation of open versus closed chromatin; and ATAC-seq, based on preferential integration of a transposon into open chromatin.

Biological networks capture structural or functional properties of relevant entities such as molecules, proteins or genes.  Characteristic examples are gene expression networks or protein-protein interaction networks, which hold information about functional affinities or structural similarities.  Such networks have been expanding in size due to increasing scale and abundance of biological data.  While various clustering algorithms have been proposed to find highly connected regions, Markov Clustering (MCL) has been one of the most successful approaches to cluster sequence similarity or expression networks.  Despite its popularity, MCL's scalability to cluster large datasets still remains a bottleneck due to high running times and memory demands.  Here, we present High-performance MCL (HipMCL), a parallel implementation of the original MCL algorithm that can run on distributed-memory computers.  We show that HipMCL can efficiently utilize 2000 compute nodes and cluster a network of ∼70 million nodes with ∼68 billion edges in ∼2. 4 h.  By exploiting distributed-memory environments, HipMCL clusters large-scale networks several orders of magnitude faster than MCL and enables clustering of even bigger networks.

Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has emerged as a highly efficacious treatment for difficult cases of refractory and/or recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI).   Recently, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been applied to treat CDI.   While previous treatments used fresh fecal slurries as a source of microbiota for FMT, we recently reported the successful use of standardized, partially purified and frozen fecal microbiota to treat CDI.   Complete Microbiota Engraftment Is Not Essential for Recovery from Recurrent Clostridium difficile Infection following Fecal Microbiota Transplantation.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has an incomparable efficacy to treat recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, with near 90% of success.  Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has provided a successful treatment method for some patients with recurrent C.  difficile infection, but its mechanism and long-term effects remain unknown.  Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), a highly effective treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, has emerged as a promising therapy for intestinal MDR bacterial decolonization.  OBJECTIVES Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is increasingly being used for treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (R-CDI) that cannot be cured with antibiotics alone.  BACKGROUND Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) restores a diverse bacterial profile to the gastrointestinal tract and may effectively treat patients with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI).  Bacterial communities from subjects treated for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (rCDI) by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), using either heterologous donor stool samples or autologous stool samples, were characterized by Illumina next-generation sequencing.  Fecal microbiota transplantation is a compelling treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infections, with potential applications against other diseases associated with changes in gut microbiota.  Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) holds considerable promise as a therapy for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, but well-designed, randomized-controlled trials and Long-term follow-up registries are stilt required.  Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and is considered as a treatment for other gastrointestinal (GI) diseases.  BACKGROUND Fecal microbiota microbiota transplantation from a healthy donor into an individual with CD infection (CDI) can resolve symptoms.  Fecal microbiota transplantation is relatively simple to perform, well-tolerated, safe and effective in recurrent Clostridium difficile infection with ulcerative pancolitis, as an alternative in case of antibiotic therapy failure.  The use of fecal microbiota transplantation in recurrent Clostridium difficile infection and coexistent inflammatory bowel disease remains unclear.

"[SOC]###context: The VISTA-16 trial of varespladib, a secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) inhibitor, in patients with an acute coronary syndrome was terminated prematurely owing to futility and a signal towards harm.  Large-scale Phase III trials are now underway with agents that lead to marked reductions in IL-6 and C-reactive protein (such as canakinumab and methotrexate) as well as with agents that impact on diverse non-IL-6-dependent pathways (such as varespladib and darapladib).   The sPLA2 inhibitor varespladib has favorable effects on lipid and inflammatory markers; however, its effect on cardiovascular outcomes is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of sPLA2 inhibition with varespladib on cardiovascular outcomes.  The sPLA2 inhibition with varespladib may be harmful and is not a useful strategy to reduce adverse cardiovascular outcomes after ACS.  The potential pro-atherogenic role of PLA(2) led to the development of two small molecules, varespladib, a reversible sPLA(2) inhibitor, and darapladib, a selective Lp-PLA(2) inhibitor.   In the present article, the enzymatic properties and the involvement of sPLA(2) and Lp-PLA(2) in atherogenesis are reviewed, with a focus on the results of experimental studies and clinical studies with both varespladib and darapladib inhibitors.  OBJECTIVE: Several secreted phospholipases A2 (sPLA2s), including group IIA, III, V, and X, have been linked to the development of atherosclerosis, which led to the clinical testing of A-002 (varespladib), a broad sPLA2 inhibitor for the treatment of coronary artery disease.   Varespladib was able to inhibit sPLA2 in the types of neonatal lung injury investigated.  sPLA2 activity was reduced in hyaline membrane disease (P &lt; . 0001), infections (P = . 003), and meconium aspiration (P = . 04) using 40 µM varespladib; 10 µM was able to lower enzyme activity (P = . 001), with an IC(50) of 87 µM Varespladib methyl is a prodrug that is rapidly metabolized to varespladib, and both compounds are able to potently inhibit the enzymes of the human secretory phospholipase groups IIa, V and X, which play a pivotal role in atherosclerotic disease and inflammation The sPLA2 inhibitor varespladib has favorable effects on lipid and inflammatory markers; however, its effect on cardiovascular outcomes is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of sPLA2 inhibition with varespladib on cardiovascular outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A double-blind, randomized, multicenter trial at 362 academic and community hospitals in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, India, and North America of 5145 patients randomized within 96 hours of presentation of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) to either varespladib (n = 2572) or placebo (n = 2573) with enrollment between June 1, 2010, and March 7, 2012 (study termination on March 9, 2012). INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to receive varespladib (500 mg) or placebo daily for 16 weeks, in addition to atorvastatin and other established therapies. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary efficacy measure was a composite of cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with evidence of ischemia requiring hospitalization at 16 weeks.   The composite secondary end point of cardiovascular mortality, MI, and stroke was observed in 107 patients (4. 6%) in the varespladib group and 79 patients (3. 8%) in the placebo group (HR, 1. 36; 95% CI, 1. 02-1. 82; P = . 04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In patients with recent ACS, varespladib did not reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events and significantly increased the risk of MI.  The sPLA2 inhibition with varespladib may be harmful and is not a useful strategy to reduce adverse cardiovascular outcomes after ACS.

The central hypothesis of this study was that treatment with varespladib, a small-molecule inhibitor of sPLA(2) would reduce postprocedural release of cardiac biomarkers after elective percutaneous coronary intervention. METHODS AND RESULTS: Between October 2007 and June 2009, 144 stable patients were randomized in a phase II trial to receive varespladib 500 mg PO BID or placebo 3 to 5 days before and for 5 days after elective percutaneous coronary intervention.   We evaluated whether endothelial function is attenuated after PCI and if inhibition of secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) activity augments endothelial function and coronary flow reserve (CFR) in these patients. METHODS: In the sPLA2 Inhibition to Decrease Enzyme Release After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (SPIDER-PCI) study, patients undergoing elective PCI were randomized to receive Varespladib (Anthera Pharmaceuticals Inc, San Mateo, CA), an inhibitor of sPLA2, or placebo 3-5 days prior to PCI and for 5 days after PCI.   The present study evaluated the effects of sPLA2-IIA inhibition with varespladib acid in a novel mouse model, human apolipoprotein B (apoB)/human cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP)/human sPLA2-IIA triple transgenic mice (TTT) fed a Western-type diet. APPROACH AND RESULTS: sPLA2-IIA expression increased atherosclerotic lesion formation in TTT compared with human apoB/human CETP double transgenic mice (P<0. 01).  Varespladib acid effectively inhibited plasma sPLA2-IIA activity.  Surprisingly, however, administration of varespladib acid to TTT had no impact on atherosclerosis, which could be attributed to a proatherogenic plasma lipoprotein profile that appears in response to sPLA2-IIA inhibition because of increased plasma CETP activity.   Acute inhibition of sPLA2 activity with Varespladib does not affect endothelial or microvascular function after PCI.  Varespladib acid effectively inhibited plasma sPLA2-IIA activity.  Surprisingly, however, administration of varespladib acid to TTT had no impact on atherosclerosis, which could be attributed to a proatherogenic plasma lipoprotein profile that appears in response to sPLA2-IIA inhibition because of increased plasma CETP activity.  We aimed at investigating the effect of co-administration of surfactant and varespladib on sPLA2 activity.  Alveolar macrophages were cultured and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and then treated with either varespladib, surfactant, varespladib followed by surfactant or nothing. 
###question: Which enzyme is inhibited by Varespladib?[EOC] [SOR]###response: Varespladib is a secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) inhibitor.  It was tested in patients with acute coronary syndrome. [EOR]"

"[SOC]###context: In Pick's disease, increased AGE, CML, CEL, HNE and MDAL bands of about 50 kDa were observed in the frontal cortex (but not in the occipital cortex) in association with increased density of glial acidic protein bands.  Thus, brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with Alzheimer's disease, Down syndrome, Pick's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and other disorders as well as brain and CSF from animals serving as models of neurological disorders have been analyzed by proteomics.   The present study is designed to investigate expression of peroxiredoxins (Prxs), the newly characterized family of highly conserved antioxidant enzymes, and other antioxidant enzymes in frontal cortex and cerebellum of DS, AD and PD patients using the technique of proteomics.   HMT levels were measured in the frontal cortex and cerebellum of brains of patients with AD, DS, and PiD, and normal aged subjects using proteomics techniques.

"[SOC]###context: We used mouse cochlear hair cells and House Ear Institute‑Organ of Corti 1 (HEI‑OC1) cells to explore the relationship between mtDNA copy number and cell apoptosis We study the vibration modes of a short section in the middle turn of the gerbil cochlea including both longitudinal and radial interstitial fluid spaces between the pillar cells and hair cells to determine the role of the interstitial fluid flow within the organ of Corti (OoC).   The cochlear sensory epithelium, the organ of Corti, vibrates because of external and internal excitations.   The cochlea, a coiled structure located in the ventral region of the inner ear, acts as the primary structure for the perception of sound.  Along the length of the cochlear spiral is the organ of Corti, a highly derived and rigorously patterned sensory epithelium that acts to convert auditory stimuli into neural impulses.

"[SOC]###context: Amifostine (WR-2721, delivered as Ethyol) is a phosphorylated aminothiol compound clinically used in addition to cis-platinum to reduce the toxic side effects of therapeutic treatment on normal cells without reducing their efficacy on tumour cells.   However, amifostine has also been described as a potent hypoxia-mimetic compound and as a strong p53 inducer; both effects are known to potently modulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) expression.  The angiogenic properties of this drug have not been clearly defined.  Both dose fractionation and amifostine protect osteoblasts from the growth inhibitory effects of ionizing radiation.  Fractionation but not amifostine was protective for hypoxia-induced vascular endothelial growth factor production (used as a surrogate marker of normal osteoblast function) Radioprotective modalities such as dose fractionation and pharmacologic agents such as amifostine have been used to protect bone and other types of normal tissue from the damaging effects of ionizing radiation without significantly impacting tumor kill.  To better understand the cellular mechanism of radioprotection of osseous tissue, the authors sought to determine the effect of dose fractionation and amifostine on isolated osteoblasts Tumor hypoxia and low intrinsic radiosensitivity may counteract the efficacy of standard radiotherapy for locally advanced head and neck cancer (HNC).  We investigated the involvement of hypoxia-regulated proteins (Hypoxia inducible factors HIF1alpha, HIF2alpha and carbonic anhydrase CA9) in HNC resistance to accelerated and hypofractionated radiotherapy  Immunohistochemical analysis of hypoxia-regulated proteins, namely HIF1alpha, HIF2alpha and CA9, was performed in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues obtained prior to radio-chemotherapy.  In accord with previously reported studies, high levels of the hypoxia regulated proteins HIF1alpha and CA9 in HNC predict resistance to platinum based radio-chemotherapy.  Whether HIF2alpha expressing tumors are more sensitive to larger radiotherapy fractions, compared to standard radiotherapy fractionation, is an issue that deserves further investigation.  Amifostine has been shown to specifically protect normal tissues from damage caused by radiation and chemotherapy.  An inactive prodrug, amifostine is converted to an active thiol by dephosphorylation by alkaline phosphatase in the normal endothelium.  The hypovascularity and acidity of the tumor environment and the differential expression of alkaline phosphatase in normal and neoplastic tissues contribute to its cytoprotective selectivity.  The cytoprotective mechanism of amifostine is complicated, involving free-radical scavenging, DNA protection and repair acceleration, and induction of cellular hypoxia.  We investigated additional cytoprotective pathways involving intracellular hypoxia and the activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway, a key transcription factor regulating glycolysis, angiogenesis and apoptosis, which is also linked with radioresistance  tumor hypoxia and ability of cancer cells to undergo rapid repopulation during radiotherapy are associated with failure of radiotherapy.  Tumors with low alpha/beta-ratio values or hypoxic tumors unable to undergo re-oxygenation, are unlikely to be eradicated with standard radiotherapy.  Although the therapeutic efficacy of accelerated regimens based on low-dose per fraction may be high since they minimize the adverse role of rapid tumor repopulation, the cellular compartment with low alpha/beta-ratio values (i. e.  hypoxic cells) remains a limiting factor.   Amifostine (Ethyol) is a prodrug that must be dephosphorylated to the free thiol in which form it can detoxify free oxygen radicals generated by radiation, hypoxia and by drugs such anthracyclines, platinum analogues and alkylating agents.  Amifostine as inactive prodrug is primarily metabolized at the tissue site by membrane alkaline phosphatase, which is highly active in the cell membranes of normal endothelial cells and biliary tree cells but not in the cell membranes and neovascular capillaries of tumor
###question: Why does the prodrug amifostine (ethyol) create hypoxia?[EOC] [SOR]###response: After the administration of Prodrug amifostine the cells of the tissue prefer anaerobic glycolysis rather than regular cellular aerobic respiration.  By the beggining of anaerobic glycolysis the inducible by hypoxia proteins are induced and by all these molecules  the hypoxic conditions consist of. [EOR]"
"[SOC]###context: Decreased survival of glioma cases with long-term and high cumulative use of wireless phones was found.   There was no significant association between glioma and alcohol consumption, smoking and mobile phone use.  Regular cell phone use was not associated with an increased risk of neuroma (OR=0,92; 95% confidence interval=[0. 53-1. 59]), meningioma (OR=0,74; 95% confidence interval=[0. 43-1. 28]) or glioma (OR=1. 15; 95% confidence interval=[0. 65-2. 05]).  Although these results are not statistically significant, a general tendency was observed for an increased risk of glioma among the heaviest users: long-term users, heavy users, users with the largest numbers of telephones.   No significant increased risk for glioma, meningioma or neuroma was observed among cell phone users participating in Interphone.    Our results, suggesting the possibility of an increased risk among the heaviest users, therefore need to be verified in the international INTERPHONE analyses.  The risk for ipsilateral use was significantly increased for astrocytoma for all studied phone types, analogue phones OR=1. 8,95% CI=1. 1-3. 2, digital phones OR=1. 8, 95% CI=1. 1-2. 8, cordless phones OR=1. 8, 95% CI=1. 1-2. 9.  For astrocytoma and ipsilateral use the trend was for analogue phones OR=1. 10, 95% CI=1. 02-1. 19, digital phones OR=1. 11, 95% CI=1. 01-1. 22, and cordless phones OR=1. 09, 95% CI=1. 01-1. 19.  There was a tendency of a shorter tumour induction period for ipsilateral exposure to microwaves than for contralateral, which may indicate a tumour promotor effect.  Case reports of brain tumours in users initiated this case-control study on brain tumours and use of cellular telephones.  Increased risk was found only for use of the NMT system.   This increased HR was based on results for astrocytoma WHO grade IV (glioblastoma multiforme).  Some studies show increasing incidence of brain tumours whereas other studies do not.  The meta-analysis gave for glioma in the most exposed part of the brain, the temporal lobe, odds ratio (OR)=1. 71, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1. 04-2. 81 in the ≥10 years (>10 years in the Hardell group) latency group.  Ipsilateral mobile phone use ≥1640h in total gave OR=2. 29, 95% CI=1. 56-3. 37.   After 1983 and during the period with increasing prevalence of mobile phone users, the incidence has remained relatively stable for both men and women. 
###question: What is the association between cell phone use and glioblastoma?[EOC] [SOR]###response: The association between cell phone use and incident glioblastoma remains unclear.  Some studies have reported that cell phone use was associated with incident glioblastoma, and with reduced survival of patients diagnosed with glioblastoma.  However, other studies have repeatedly replicated to find an association between cell phone use and glioblastoma. [EOR]"
"[SOC]###context: We used a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based mRNA differential display (DD) analysis to obtain a profile of thyroid hormone-responsive genes in osteoblast-like cells At the 2-hour time point, 1 true-positive novel clone was identified and shown to be the mitochondrial gene, subunit 6 of ATP synthase (ATPase-6).  We studied the coordination of the two genomes by measuring transcript levels for nuclear (IV, Va, and VIc) and mitochondrial (II and III) subunits of cytochrome-c oxidase after altering the mitochondrial content of rat muscle and liver by altering the thyroid state of the animals.  Tissue levels of these mRNAs were generally decreased in hypothyroid animals and were up-regulated again after thyroid hormone (T3) treatment.  Following this procedure, we now report the identification of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 3 (ND3) gene as target of thyroid hormone.  Sequencing and electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed the presence of a thyroid hormone receptor (TR)/c-erbA specific binding site in the mitochondrial ND3 gene.

Because viruses borrow molecular mechanisms from their hosts, we searched highly abundant human long-noncoding RNAs and identified putative ENE-like structures in metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) and multiple endocrine neoplasia-β (MENβ) RNAs.   MALAT1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1) locus is misregulated in many human cancers and produces an abundant long nuclear-retained noncoding RNA.  Many long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) appear to have epigenetic regulatory function in humans, including HOTAIR and XIST.  metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1, MALAT1, is a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that has been discovered as a marker for lung cancer metastasis.  It is highly abundant, its expression is strongly regulated in many tumor entities including lung adenocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma as well as physiological processes, and it is associated with many RNA binding proteins and highly conserved throughout evolution.  Thus, loss of the abundant nuclear long ncRNA MALAT1 is compatible with cell viability and normal development.  bundant expression of the long noncoding (lnc) PAN (polyadenylated nuclear) RNA by the human oncogenic gammaherpesvirus Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) depends on a cis-element called the expression and nuclear retention element (ENE) alat1 is an abundant long, noncoding RNA that localizes to nuclear bodies known as nuclear speckles, which contain a distinct set of pre-mRNA processing factors.

"[SOC]###context: Pyridostigmine is the most widely used acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.  For more than 50 years the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor pyridostigmine bromide has been the drug of choice in the symptomatic therapy for myasthenia gravis.   The switch to SR-Pyr ameliorated the total quantified myasthenia gravis (QMG) score from 0. 9 ± 0. 5 to 0. 6 ± 0. 4 (p<0. 001) in all patients and in the younger subgroup.  This was accompanied by a significant improvement in the quality of life parameters.  The health status valued by EuroQoL questionnaire improved from 0. 626 ± 0. 286 to 0. 782 ± 0. 186 (p<0. 001).   Our results support the usefulness of SR-Pyr in an individualized therapeutic regimen to improve quality of life regardless of the patient's age in myasthenia gravis.  This review focuses on treatment of MG, mainly on the use of the AChE inhibitor pyridostigmine.  Despite a lack of data from well controlled clinical trials to support their use, AChE inhibitors, of which pyridostigmine is the most commonly used, are recommended as first-line therapy for MG.   Novel AChE inhibitors with oral antisense oligonucleotides have been developed and preliminary results appear to be promising.  Except for one small and inconclusive trial of intranasal neostigmine, no randomised controlled trial has been conducted on the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in myasthenia gravis.  Response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in observational studies is so clear that a randomised controlled trial depriving participants in the placebo arm of treatment would be difficult to justify.   Current guidelines and recommendations for MG treatment are based largely on clinical experience, retrospective analyses and expert consensus.  Available therapies include oral acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors for symptomatic treatment, and short- and long-term disease-modifying treatments.  Pyridostigmine has been used as a treatment for MG for over 50 years and is generally considered safe.  It is suitable as a long-term treatment in patients with generalized non-progressive milder disease, and as an adjunctive therapy in patients with severe disease who are also receiving immunotherapy.   Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors provide temporary, symptomatic treatment for all forms of myasthenia gravis.

NGS and FISH analysis verified that the supernumerary marker chromosome carried by the fetus was der(22) t(11; 22) (q23;q11).   Emanuel syndrome is associated with supernumerary chromosome, which consists of the extra genetic material from chromosome 11 and 22.   Multiple congenital anomalies and craniofacial dysmorphism are characterizing the so-called Emanuel or supernumerary der(22)t(11;22) syndrome (OMIM609029).   Complex sSMCs consist of chromosomal material derived from more than one chromosome, for example, the derivative der(22)t(11;22)(q23;q11. 2) in Emanuel syndrome.  A case with Emanuel syndrome: extra derivative 22 chromosome inherited from the mother.   Affected children are usually identified in the newborn period as the offspring of balanced (11;22) translocation carriers.  We report a 3-year-old boy with the t(11;22)(q23;q11) chromosome, transmitted in an unbalanced fashion from his mother.   Balanced carriers of t(11;22) usually manifest no clinical symptoms, and are often identified after the birth of offspring with an unbalanced form of this translocation, known as Emanuel syndrome.   Derivative 11;22 (emanuel) syndrome: a case report and a review.  Complex sSMC consist of chromosomal material derived from more than one chromosome; the best known representative of this group is the derivative chromosome 22 {der(22)t(11;22)} or Emanuel syndrome.   The syndrome is caused by chromosomal imbalance due to a supernumerary derivative chromosome 22.   We have generated iPSCs from monosomy X [Turner syndrome (TS)], trisomy 8 (Warkany syndrome 2), trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) and partial trisomy 11;22 (Emanuel syndrome), using either skin fibroblasts from affected individuals or amniocytes from antenatal diagnostic tests.   Emanuel syndrome is an inherited chromosomal abnormality resulting from 3:1 meiotic segregation from parental balanced translocation carrier t(11;22)(q23;q11), mostly of maternal origin.   Here in, we describe a female patient with supernumerary der(22) syndrome (Emanuel syndrome) due to balanced translocation carrier father t(11;22) (q23;q11).   The t(11;22)(q23;q11. 2) is the main recurrent germline translocation in humans.  Unbalanced translocation can be transmitted to the progeny and can cause Emanuel syndrome.  Complex small supernumerary marker chromosomes (sSMCs) constitute one of the smallest subsets within the patients with an sSMC.

identified as recurrent breakpoints in the complex ssmc were characterized it is to be expected that more syndromes are identified in this subgroup of ssmc overall complex ssmc emphasize once more the importance of detailed cytogenetic analyses especially in patients with idiopathic mental retardation.  emanuel syndrome is characterized by multiple congenital anomalies and developmental disability it is caused by the presence of a supernumerary derivative chromosome that contains material from chromosomes 11 and 22 the origin of this imbalance is 3 1 malsegregation of a parental balanced

"[SOC]###context: After measuring thermal effects of TCS and imaging artefact sizes of DBS lead using a skull phantom, we prospectively enrolled 34 patients with DBS of globus pallidus internus, ventro-intermediate thalamic or subthalamic nucleus.  TCS had no influence on lead temperature, electrical parameters of DBS device or clinical state of patients.  TCS measures of lead coordinates agreed with MRI measures in anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axis.  Lead dislocation requiring reinsertion was reliably detected.  TCS may therefore become a first-choice modality to monitor lead location.  Two pilot studies have demonstrated that the intraoperative visualization with TCS and the TCS-assisted insertion of deep-brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes into the subthalamic nucleus and the globus pallidus interna are feasible and safe provided there is exact knowledge on the extent of electrode TCS imaging artifacts.   Peroperative transcranial sonography for electrode placement into the targeted subthalamic nucleus of patients with Parkinson disease: technical note The correct anatomic position of the electrode tip could be indirectly assessed thanks to the topographic relationship of the STN with the hyperechogenic substantia nigra and the nucleus ruber.  CONCLUSIONS: Transcranial sonography is easily feasible during stereotactic surgery.  In combination with the clinical effects of electrostimulation on the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and with stereotactic x-ray images, it enables the assessment and the documentation of the correct position of implanted STN electrodes in real time.

"[SOC]###context: Introduction of PSA screening will increase total healthcare costs for prostate cancer substantially, of which the actual screening costs will be a small part.  The vast majority of citizens in nine European countries systematically overestimate the benefits of mammography and PSA screening.  In the countries investigated, physicians and other information sources appear to have little impact on improving citizens' perceptions of these benefits.  National systematic prostate cancer screening programmes outside randomised clinical trial settings have not been implemented to date owing to lack of robust evidence that such programmes would improve survival and/or quality of life in men with screen-detected disease.  In the case of prostate cancer screening, two systematic reviews have concluded that screening should not be carried out.  In general, this recommendation has been accepted in the United Kingdom.  Screening for early disease has been available for many years, but there is still no national screening programme established in the United Kingdom.   the positive predictive value of PSA screening in BRCA mutation carriers is high and that screening detects clinically significant prostate cancer.  Web-based decision aids are known to have an effect on knowledge, attitude, and behavior; important components of informed decision making Increased usage of Prosdex leads to more informed decision making, the key aim of the UK Prostate Cancer Risk Management Programme.   Prostate specific antigen (PSA) was introduced as a prostate cancer screening tool more than 20 years ago.  However, there is continuing debate regarding its utility in screening for prostate cancer.  Mass screening is costly, may result in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancers that never become clinically significant, and the evidence of a subsequent reduction in mortality is inconclusive.  In addition to its role in screening, PSA is also used to monitor the progression of the disease, both localized and metastatic.  Although the evidence is contradictory, PSA is still an important tool for monitoring patient progression following treatment of definitive localized prostate cancer.

"[SOC]###context: The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) is a widely used rodent model of hypertension and metabolic syndrome.  Previously we identified thousands of cis-regulated expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) across multiple tissues using a panel of rat recombinant inbred (RI) strains derived from Brown Norway and SHR progenitors.  These cis-eQTLs represent potential susceptibility loci underlying physiological and pathophysiological traits manifested in SHR.  We have prioritized 60 cis-eQTLs and confirmed differential expression between the parental strains by quantitative PCR in 43 (72%) of the eQTL transcripts.  These colocalizing correlated cis-eQTLs (c3-eQTLs) are highly attractive as primary susceptibility loci for the colocalizing pQTLs.  Furthermore, sequence analysis of the c3-eQTL genes identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are predicted to affect transcription factor binding affinity, splicing and protein function.  These SNPs, which potentially alter transcript abundance and stability, represent strong candidate factors underlying not just eQTL expression phenotypes, but also the correlated metabolic and physiological traits.  In conclusion, by integration of genomic sequence, eQTL and QTT datasets we have identified several genes that are strong positional candidates for pathophysiological traits observed in the SHR strain.  Identifying associations between genotypes and gene expression levels using microarrays has enabled systematic interrogation of regulatory variation underlying complex phenotypes.  This approach has vast potential for functional characterization of disease states, but its prohibitive cost, given hundreds to thousands of individual samples from populations have to be genotyped and expression profiled, has limited its widespread application. RESULTS: Here we demonstrate that genomic regions with allele-specific expression (ASE) detected by sequencing cDNA are highly enriched for cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) identified by profiling of 500 animals in parallel, with up to 90% agreement on the allele that is preferentially expressed.  We also observed widespread noncoding and antisense ASE and identified several allele-specific alternative splicing variants. CONCLUSION: Monitoring ASE by sequencing cDNA from as little as one sample is a practical alternative to expression genetics for mapping cis-acting variation that regulates RNA transcription and processing.  The six genes corresponded to rat and mouse quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that had shown associations with the common traits such as the well characterized MS and even tumor susceptibility.  Our findings suggest that the six genes may play important roles in the pleiotropic effects on lipid metabolism and the MS, which increase the risk of Type 2 Diabetes and cardiovascular disease.  The use of the multivariate phenotypes can be advantageous in identifying genetic risk factors, accounting for the pleiotropic effects when the multivariate phenotypes have a common etiological pathway.  To elucidate mechanisms involved in multiple sclerosis (MS), we studied genetic regulation of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in rats, assuming a conservation of pathogenic pathways.  In this study, we focused on Eae23, originally identified to regulate EAE in a (LEW. 1AV1xPVG. 1AV1)F2 cross.  Our aim was to determine whether one or more genes within the 67 Mb region regulate EAE and to define candidate risk genes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used high resolution quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis in the 10th generation (G10) of an advanced intercross line (AIL) to resolve Eae23 into two QTLs that independently regulate EAE, namely Eae23a and Eae23b.

In the SQUIRE phase III trial, necitumumab added to cisplatin and gemcitabine increased the survival in patients with advanced squamous cell NSCLC.   BACKGROUND: Necitumumab is a second-generation recombinant human immunoglobulin G1 EGFR monoclonal antibody that competitively inhibits ligand binding.   Numerous other drugs are in earlier stages of development for HNSCC treatment, including novel anti-EGFR mAbs (MEHD7945A, necitumumab, and RO5083945), small-molecule TKIs (vandetanib, icotinib, and CUDC-101), EGFR antisense, various add-on therapies to radiation and chemotherapy (bevacizumab, interleukin-12, lenalidomide, alisertib, and VTX-2337), and drugs (temsirolimus, everolimus, OSI-906, dasatinib, and PX-866) intended to overcome resistance to anti-EGFR agents.   Necitumumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody, is currently evaluated in combination with chemotherapy in two phase III trials in patients with advanced NSCLC.   Necitumumab is currently evaluated in combination with chemotherapy in two randomized phase III trials.

"[SOC]###context: kidney dysfunction and decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) are diagnosed by the evaluation of changes in the serum creatinine (SCr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentrations.   Renal biomarkers, especially those present in urine, may be useful for the study of both acute and chronic nephropathies.  The International Renal Interest Society (IRIS) canine AKI grading system and the implementation of urinary biomarkers Decreased tryptophan (TRP) and increased kynurenine (KYN) and kynurenic acid (KYNA) in blood have been reported in patients and experimental animals with renal diseases.  Acute kidney injury was defined as a decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate of 50% or more from the beginning of vancomycin therapy.    In critically ill children, the development of reversible AKI during vancomycin therapy is associated with administration of nephrotoxic drugs and an elevated BUN: Scr ratio.  The physiologic determination of renal status is the measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR).  Serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, cystatin C, and estimated GFR (eGFR), based on serum creatinine have failed to replace mGFR.  After kidney donation, renal function measured by blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine of all donors returned to normal within one week, and no serious complications were noticed.   In living kidney donors GFR is not significantly correlated with age or sex.  Increased proteinuria would lead to a larger risk for renal failure in the long term A reduction of proteinuria in patients with non-diabetic renal disease was observed during the 4-month treatment with pioglitazone which continued for 2 months after the cessation of the treatment.  However, 4 months after the cessation of the treatment, a little increase was detected in the level of proteinuria.  We identify pleiotropic associations among these loci with kidney function-related traits and risk of CKD.

Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome (MRS) is a rare neuromucocutaneous syndrome marked by the triad of recurrent nonpitting orofacial edema, fissured dorsal tongue (lingua plicata), and lower motoneuron facial paralysis.  Recurrent facial nerve palsy, facial swelling, and fissured tongue are the symptoms and signs of this condition.  However, this triad is not typical in all patients as patients may present with one or more of the symptoms, which makes management of this condition difficult.   Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome may manifest as the classical triad (orofacial edema, facial nerve palsy and stable lingua plicata) but monosymptomatic manifestations or combinations of typical symptoms are not infrequent.

"[SOC]###context: Autism and esophageal achalasia in childhood: a possible correlation? In the last case, a 15-year-old male underwent barium swallow and endoscopy that confirmed achalasia.  Intestinal mucosal pathology, characterized by ileo-colonic lymphoid nodular hyperplasia (LNH) and mild acute and chronic inflammation of the colorectum, small bowel and stomach, has been reported in children with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) Ileo-colonic LNH is a characteristic pathological finding in children with ASD and gastrointestinal symptoms, and is associated with mucosal inflammation.  The data support the hypothesis that LNH is a significant pathological finding in ASD children.  A relationship between autism and gastrointestinal (GI) immune dysregulation has been postulated based on incidence of GI complaints as well as macroscopically observed lymphonodular hyperplasia and microscopically determined enterocolitis in pediatric patients with autism.  These data fail to support an association between autism and GI inflammation.  Intestinal pathology, i. e. , ileocolonic lymphoid nodular hyperplasia (LNH) and mucosal inflammation, has been described in children with developmental disorders.  This study describes some of the endoscopic and pathological characteristics in a group of children with developmental disorders (affected children) that are associated with behavioral regression and bowel symptoms, and compares them with pediatric controls.  METHODS: Ileocolonoscopy and biopsy were performed on 60 affected children (median age 6 yr, range 3-16; 53 male).  Developmental diagnoses were autism (50 patients), Asperger's syndrome (five), disintegrative disorder (two), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (one), schizophrenia (one), and dyslexia (one).  Ileal LNH was present in 54 of 58 (93%) affected children and in five of 35 (14. 3%) controls (p < 0. 001).  Colonic LNH was present in 18 of 60 (30%) affected children and in two of 37 (5. 4%) controls (p < 0. 01).  Histologically, reactive follicular hyperplasia was present in 46 of 52 (88. 5%) ileal biopsies from affected children and in four of 14 (29%) with UC, but not in non-IBD controls (p < 0. 01).  Active ileitis was present in four of 51 (8%) affected children but not in controls.  Chronic colitis was identified in 53 of 60 (88%) affected children compared with one of 22 (4. 5%) controls and in 20 of 20 (100%) with UC Thirty-six children (age: 5. 7 +/- 2 years, mean +/- SD) with autistic disorder underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsies, intestinal and pancreatic enzyme analyses, and bacterial and fungal cultures Histologic examination in these 36 children revealed grade I or II reflux esophagitis in 25 (69. 4%), chronic gastritis in 15, and chronic duodenitis in 24.  The number of Paneth's cells in the duodenal crypts was significantly elevated in autistic children compared with non-autistic control subjects.  Low intestinal carbohydrate digestive enzyme activity was reported in 21 children (58. 3%), although there was no abnormality found in pancreatic function.  Seventy-five percent of the autistic children (27/36) had an increased pancreatico-biliary fluid output after intravenous secretin administration.  Nineteen of the 21 patients with diarrhea had significantly higher fluid output than those without diarrhea.  Unrecognized gastrointestinal disorders, especially reflux esophagitis and disaccharide malabsorption, may contribute to the behavioral problems of the non-verbal autistic patients.

"[SOC]###context: With Idarucizumab and Andexanet Alfa, specific antidotes have been developed against both, direct thrombin inhibitors as well as direct Factor Xa inhibitors.   Three novel molecules (idarucizumab, andexanet, and PER977) may provide the most effective and safest way of reversal.   Idarucizumab Improves Outcome in Murine Brain Hemorrhage Related to Dabigatran.  We examined the efficacy of idarucizumab, an antibody fragment binding to dabigatran, in a mouse model of OAC-ICH.  Dabigatran etexilate (DE) dose-dependently prolonged diluted thrombin time and tail-vein bleeding time, which were reversed by idarucizumab.   Thus, idarucizumab prevents excess intracerebral hematoma formation in mice anticoagulated with dabigatran and reduces mortality.  BACKGROUND: Idarucizumab is a monoclonal antibody fragment that binds dabigatran with high affinity in a 1:1 molar ratio.  We investigated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of increasing doses of idarucizumab for the reversal of anticoagulant effects of dabigatran in a two-part phase 1 study (rising-dose assessment and dose-finding, proof-of-concept investigation).  Safety, tolerability, and efficacy of idarucizumab for the reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran in healthy male volunteers: a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase 1 trial.  INTERPRETATION: These phase 1 results show that idarucizumab was associated with immediate, complete, and sustained reversal of dabigatran-induced anticoagulation in healthy men, and was well tolerated with no unexpected or clinically relevant safety concerns, supporting further testing.   Idarucizumab for Dabigatran Reversal.  Idarucizumab, an antibody fragment, was developed to reverse the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran. METHODS: We undertook this prospective cohort study to determine the safety of 5 g of intravenous idarucizumab and its capacity to reverse the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran in patients who had serious bleeding (group A) or required an urgent procedure (group B).  . CONCLUSIONS: Idarucizumab completely reversed the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran within minutes.

"[SOC]###context: Oral Tecovirimat for the Treatment of Smallpox.  CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of its efficacy in two animal models and pharmacokinetic and safety data in humans, tecovirimat is being advanced as a therapy for smallpox in accordance with the FDA Animal Rule.  Background: Tecovirimat (ST-246) is being developed as an antiviral therapeutic for smallpox for use in the event of an accidental or intentional release.   Conclusions: Tecovirimat treatment initiated up to 8 days following a lethal aerosol MPXV challenge improves survival and, when initiated earlier than 5 days after challenge, provides protection from clinical effects of disease, supporting the conclusion that it is a promising smallpox antiviral therapeutic candidate.  Tecovirimat: First Global Approval.  In July 2018, oral tecovirimat was approved in the USA for the treatment of human smallpox disease caused by variola virus in adults and paediatric patients weighing ≥ 13 kg.  An intravenous formulation of tecovirimat is undergoing phase I development for the treatment of smallpox infection.   Brincidofovir, an oral antiviral in late stage development, has proven effective against orthopoxviruses in vitro and in vivo, has a different mechanism of action from tecovirimat (the only oral smallpox antiviral currently in the US Strategic National Stockpile), and has a resistance profile that reduces concerns in the scenario of a bioterror attack using genetically engineered smallpox.  Treatment with the smallpox antiviral tecovirimat (ST-246) alone or in combination with ACAM2000 vaccination is effective as a postsymptomatic therapy for monkeypox virus infection.  Tecovirimat appears to be an effective smallpox therapeutic in nonhuman primates, suggesting that it is reasonably likely to provide therapeutic benefit in smallpox-infected humans.

"[SOC]###context: Gene fusion is an important evolutionary process.  It can yield valuable information to infer the interactions and functions of proteins.  We have developed a Bayesian framework to infer phosphorylation networks from time series measurements of phosphosite concentrations upon ligand stimulation.  To increase the prediction accuracy we integrated different types of data, e. g. , amino acid sequence data, genomic context data (gene fusion, gene neighborhood, and phylogentic profiles) It is assumed that two proteins, which are found to be transcribed by a single transcript in one (or several) genomes are likely to be functionally linked, for example by acting in a same metabolic pathway or by forming a multiprotein complex.  This method is of particular interest for studying genes that exhibit no, or only remote, homologies with already well-characterized proteins.  PLEX search results are accompanied by quantitative estimates of linkage confidence, enabling users to take advantage of coinheritance, operon and gene fusion-based methods for inferring gene function and reconstructing cellular systems and pathways.  While phylogenomic profiles remain the central focus of Phydbac2, it now integrates chromosomal proximity and gene fusion analyses as two additional non-similarity-based indicators for inferring pairwise gene functional relationships.  detection of gene fusion events can contribute towards the elucidation of functional associations of proteins within entire genomes Inference of gene function based on gene fusion events: the rosetta-stone method.  protein domain fusions in human protein interaction networks prediction Some proteins, involved in a common biological process and encoded by separate genes in one organism, can be found fused within a single protein chain in other organisms.  By detecting these triplets, a functional relationship can be established between the unfused proteins.  These results suggest that domain fusion is an appropriate method for predicting protein complexes.  The detection of gene fusion events across genomes can be used for the prediction of functional associations of proteins, including physical interactions or complex formation.  These genomic constraints form the basis for a variety of techniques that employ systematic genome comparisons to predict functional associations among genes.  The most powerful techniques to date are based on conserved gene neighborhood, gene fusion events, and common phylogenetic distributions of gene families Functional links between proteins can often be inferred from genomic associations between the genes that encode them: groups of genes that are required for the same function tend to show similar species coverage, are often located in close proximity on the genome (in prokaryotes), and tend to be involved in gene-fusion events.  Genes linked by fusion events are generally of the same functional category a functional association between two genes can be derived from the existence of a fusion of the two as one continuous sequence in another genome Protein interaction maps for complete genomes based on gene fusion events Because there must be selective pressure for certain genes to be fused over the course of evolution, we are able to predict functional associations of proteins.  We observed that gene fusion events are more related to physical interaction between proteins than to other weaker functional relationships such as participation in a common biological pathway.  FusionDB provides a characterization of a large number of gene fusion events at hand of multiple sequence alignments.  Domain fusion analysis has been proposed recently to infer the functional association of the component proteins.  Here we present a method that identifies gene-fusion events in complete genomes, solely based on sequence comparison. 
###question: How could we infer functional associations from gene fusion events?[EOC] [SOR]###response: The detection of gene fusion events across genomes can be used for the prediction of functional associations of proteins, based on the observation that related proteins in one organism (including physically interacting proteins/members of complexes, proteins involved in the same pathway) tend to be found in other species as a fused composite gene encoding a single multifunctional protein.  For this purpose, gene fusion events may be used as the sole evidence or as independent information combined with other 'genome-aware' or similarity-based methods, and functional association may be predicted at different levels.  An advantage of this approach is that it is not necessary to know the function of the composite/components to infer association. [EOR]"
"[SOC]###context: A point mutation in the gene encoding Ca(V)1. 2 causes Timothy syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).  o circumvent this issue, we have developed a method using human-induced pluripotent stem cells to generate cardiomyocytes from individuals with Timothy syndrome (TS), a genetic disorder characterized by QT prolongation, ventricular tachycardia, and autism.  Two de novo point mutations of Ca(v)1. 2 glycine residues, G406R and G402S, cause a rare multisystem disorder called Timothy syndrome (TS).  Here, we discuss recent work on the mechanisms by which Ca(v)1. 2 channels bearing TS mutations display slowed inactivation that leads to increased Ca(2+) influx, prolonging the cardiac AP and promoting lethal arrhythmias Timothy syndrome is a human genetic disorder due to mutations in the Ca(V)1. 2 gene.  Timothy syndrome (TS) is a disease caused by a gain-of-function mutation in the CaV1. 2 channel (CaV1. 2-TS) that decreases inactivation of the channel, which increases Ca(2+) influx, prolongs APs, and causes lethal arrhythmias.   Recent reports suggest that parental mosaicism is involved in the heritability of type 1 Timothy syndrome (TS1), an extremely rare and life-threatening multisystem disorder characterized by severe QT interval prolongation, syndactyly, and several other complications.   Timothy syndrome, long QT syndrome type 8, is highly malignant with ventricular tachyarrhythmia.  Timothy syndrome (TS) is a rare long-QT syndrome caused by CACNA1C mutations G406R in exon 8A (TS1) and G402S/G406R in exon 8 (TS2).  Timothy syndrome is caused by a missense mutation in the L-type calcium channel Ca(v)1. 2 that is associated with developmental delay and autism.  Long QT, syndactyly, joint contractures, stroke and novel CACNA1C mutation: expanding the spectrum of Timothy syndrome.  Timothy syndrome (TS) is an autosomal dominant condition with the constellation of features including prolonged QT interval, hand and foot abnormalities, and mental retardation or autism.  Timothy syndrome type 1 (TS-1) is a rare disorder that affects multiple organ systems and has a high incidence of sudden death due to profound QT prolongation and resultant ventricular arrhythmias.  In some rare cases, such as Timothy syndrome (TS), a specific mutation in a single gene can be sufficient to generate autism or ASD in most patients, potentially offering insights into the etiology of autism in general.  Both variants of TS (the milder TS1 and the more severe TS2) arise from missense mutations in alternatively spliced exons that cause the same G406R replacement in the Ca(V)1. 2 L-type calcium channel.  A gain-of-function G406R mutation in a cytoplasmic loop of Ca(V)1. 2 channels causes long QT syndrome 8 (LQT8), a disease also known as Timothy syndrome.   A missense mutation in the L-type calcium channel Ca(V)1. 2 leads to LQTS in patients with Timothy syndrome.  Timothy syndrome is a multisystem disorder characterized by cardiac, hand/foot, facial, and neurodevelopmental features.  The two forms are type 1 (classic) and type 2, a rare form caused by mutations in a transcript variant of the same gene.  Cardiac findings include a rate-corrected QT interval of between 480 ms and 700 ms and congenital heart defects (patent ductus arteriosus, patent foramen ovale, ventricular septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy).  Hand/foot findings are unilateral or bilateral cutaneous syndactyly variably involving fingers two (index), three (middle), four (ring), and five (little) and bilateral cutaneous syndactyly of toes two and three.  Facial findings include flat nasal bridge, low-set ears, thin upper lip, and round face.  Neuropsychiatric involvement includes global developmental delays and autism spectrum disorders.  Ventricular tachyarrhythmia is the leading cause of death, followed by infection and complications of intractable hypoglycemia.  Average age of death is 2. 5 years.   The gain-of-function mutations were found at two mutually exclusive exons in patients with Timothy syndrome (TS).  These patients exhibit prolonged QT interval and lethal cardiac arrhythmias.  TS patients also suffer from multi-organ dysfunction that includes neurological disorder such as autism and mental retardation reflecting the wide tissue distribution of CaV1. 2 channel.  Unexpectedly, TS patients may develop recurrent infections and bronchitis that suggests a role of CaV1. 2 channel in the immune system.  Timothy syndrome (TS) is a disease of excessive cellular Ca(2+) entry and life-threatening arrhythmias caused by a mutation in the primary cardiac L-type Ca(2+) channel (Ca(V)1. 2).  The TS mutation causes loss of normal voltage-dependent inactivation of Ca(V)1. 2 current (I(Ca)).  During cellular Ca(2+) overload, the calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) causes arrhythmias.   Timothy syndrome is a multisystem disorder associated with the mutation of a Gly residue (G402 or G406) in the Ca(v)1. 2 Ca(2+) channel.  G406 is localized at the end of the IS6 segment and just before the intracellular I-II loop, which is important for the regulation of channel inactivation and the binding of the Ca(v)beta subunit.  Inactivation of Ca2+ channel activity is perturbed in a rare yet devastating disorder known as Timothy syndrome (TS), whose features include autism or autism spectrum disorder along with severe cardiac arrhythmia and developmental abnormalities.  Most cases of TS arise from a sporadic single nucleotide change that generates a mutation (G406R) in the pore-forming subunit of the L-type Ca2+ channel Ca(V)1. 2.  Timothy syndrome is a multisystem disorder associated with QT interval prolongation and ventricular cardiac arrhythmias.  The syndrome has been linked to mutations in Ca(V)1. 2 resulting in gain of function of the L-type calcium current (I(Ca,L)).

The majority of the drugs in development belong to the class of direct factor Xa inhibitors (the -xabans).  These include betrixaban, letaxaban, darexaban, eribaxaban, and LY517717.  Examples of direct factor Xa inhibitors include apixaban, rivaroxaban, otamixaban, betrixaban and edoxaban.   EXPERT OPINION: A large body of Phase II and Phase III data is now available for FXa inhibitors such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban and betrixaban.  Another factor Xa inhibitor, edoxaban, is under evaluation in an ongoing phase III clinical trial and others such as AZD0837, betrixaban and darexaban are still in safety and tolerability phase II studies.  Apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban are small-molecule, selective inhibitors that directly and reversibly bind to the active site of factor Xa.   Novel oral anticoagulant drugs, the direct thrombin antagonist dabigatran and factor Xa inhibitors such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban are more predictable and convenient anticoagulants in comparison with warfarin, mainly because of the non-requirement of regular laboratory monitoring and dose adjustments.  Recently developed anticoagulants include direct thrombin antagonists such as dabigatran or factor Xa inhibitors such as rivaroxaban, apixaban, betrixaban, and edoxaban.   Direct factor Xa inhibitors include rivaroxiban, which has shown promising results for VTE prophylaxis and is being studied for VTE treatment, as well as apixaban and betrixaban, which are at earlier stages of clinical validation.  Two direct factor Xa inhibitors are emerging from phase II trials (betrixaban and YM150) and three are being evaluated in phase III trials (apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban) for the prevention of stroke and systemic emboli in patients with atrial fibrillation.   Apixaban, rivaroxaban, endoxaban, and betrixaban are specific direct inhibitors of factor Xa, while dabigatran inhibits factor IIa.

Our data reveal another mechanism through which KB-R7943 may protect against calcium-induced injury, as well as a novel means to inhibit the mitochondrial permeability transition pore.  KB-R7943, a plasma membrane Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger inhibitor, blocks opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore.  Inhibitors of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, a mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter (MCU) regulator, also prevented MPTP formation and arachidonic acid release induced by A23187 and H2O2.   Unlike pyrrophenone, the diacylglycerol analog 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol and CsA blocked cell death and arachidonic acid release not by preventing mitochondrial calcium uptake but by inhibiting MPTP formation.  Incubation with β3AR agonist (BRL37344, 7 μmol/L) significantly reduced cell death in isolated adult mouse cardiomyocytes during hypoxia/reoxygenation and decreased susceptibility to deleterious opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), via a mechanism dependent on the Akt-NO signaling pathway.   Here we show that antamanide inhibits the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, a central effector of cell death induction, by targeting the pore regulator cyclophilin D.  Indeed, (i) permeability transition pore inhibition by antamanide is not additive with the cyclophilin D-binding drug cyclosporin A, (ii) the inhibitory action of antamanide on the pore requires phosphate, as previously shown for cyclosporin A; (iii) antamanide is ineffective in mitochondria or cells derived from cyclophilin D null animals, and (iv) abolishes CyP-D peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity.  Furthermore, in wild-type (non-transfected) SHSY5Y cells, the effects of lactacystin on mitochondrial function and cell viability are also prevented by cyclosporin A (1 μM) which blocks the activity of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore Exogenous zinc protects cardiac cells from reperfusion injury by targeting mitochondrial permeability transition pore through inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta.  Bradykinin prevents reperfusion injury by targeting mitochondrial permeability transition pore through glycogen synthase kinase 3beta.  HIF-1 reduces ischaemia-reperfusion injury in the heart by targeting the mitochondrial permeability transition pore.  Pre—treatment of gallic acid and mitochondrially targeted gallic acid to sodium nitroprusside treated mitochondria not only significantly reduced the oxidative stress but also prevented mitochondrial permeability pore transition to a significant difference.  Mitochondrially targeted gallic acid was found more effective in reducing oxidative stress and mitochondrial permeability pore transition than gallic acid.  Mitochondrially targeted gallic acid was found more effective in reducing oxidative stress and mitochondrial permeability pore transition than gallic acid.  We conclude that mitochondrially targeted gallic acid can be used for preventing mitochondrial impairment caused by oxidative stress.  The involvement of mitochondrial permeability transition pore was determined with a mitochondrial permeability transition pore opener atractyloside and a specific mitochondrial permeability transition pore inhibitor cyclosporin A.  Here we show that antamanide inhibits the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, a central effector of cell death induction, by targeting the pore regulator cyclophilin D.

Oral fexinidazole for late-stage African Trypanosoma brucei gambiense trypanosomiasis: a pivotal multicentre, randomised, non-inferiority trial.  Therefore, we aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of an oral regimen of fexinidazole (a 2-substituted 5-nitroimidazole with proven trypanocidal activity) versus nifurtimox eflornithine combination therapy in patients with late-stage g-HAT.  INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that oral fexinidazole is effective and safe for the treatment of T b gambiense infection compared with nifurtimox eflornithine combination therapy in late-stage HAT patients.  AIM: Fexinidazole (FEX) is a nitroimidazole being developed as a new trypanocide treatment for human African trypanosomiasis/sleeping sickness.   We also observed that fexinidazole and fexinidazole sulfone are more effective than benznidazole and nifurtimox as curative treatments, particularly for acute stage infections, most likely as a result of the higher and more prolonged exposure of the sulfone derivative.  Specifically, the authors review the nitroimidazole compound fexinidazole, which is one of the few drugs which have reached Phase II trials.   New tools considered include tiny targets for tsetse fly control, use of rapid diagnostic tests and oral treatment with fexinidazole or oxaboroles.   Fexinidazole metabolites were effective in treating T.  cruzi in a mouse model of acute infection, with cure rates superior to those achieved with either fexinidazole itself or benznidazole.  Fexinidazole treatment was also shown to reduce myocarditis in all animals infected with VL-10 or Colombian resistant T.  cruzi strains, although parasite eradication was not achieved in all treated animals at the tested doses. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS</b>: Fexinidazole is an effective oral treatment of acute and chronic experimental CD caused by benznidazole-susceptible, partially resistant, and resistant T.  cruzi.

"[SOC]###context: The Alu element has been a major source of new exons during primate evolution.  Thousands of human genes contain spliced exons derived from Alu elements.  More than 25% of Alu exons analyzed by RNA-Seq have estimated transcript inclusion levels of at least 50% in the human cerebellum, indicating widespread establishment of Alu exons in human genes.  his study presents genomic evidence that a major functional consequence of Alu exonization is the lineage-specific evolution of translational regulation.  Our data suggests that lineage-specific exonization events should be determined by the combination event of the formation of splicing sites and protection against site-specific mutation pressures.  These evolutionary mechanisms could be major sources for primate diversification.  Exonization of Alu elements creates primate-specific genomic diversity Our data show that, once acquired, some exonizations were lost again in some lineages.  In general, Alu exonization occurred at various time points over the evolutionary history of primate lineages, and protein-coding potential was acquired either relatively soon after integration or millions of years thereafter.  Once integrated, they have the potential to become exapted as functional modules, e. g. , as protein-coding domains via alternative splicing.  This particular process is also termed exonization and increases protein versatility alternative ""Alu-exons"" also carry the potential to greatly enhance genetic diversity by increasing the transcriptome of primates chiefly via alternative splicing.  ere, we report a 5' exon generated from one of the two alternative transcripts in human tumor necrosis factor receptor gene type 2 (p75TNFR) that contains an ancient Alu-SINE, which provides an alternative N-terminal protein-coding domain. 
###question: Can protein coding exons originate from ALU sequences?[EOC] [SOR]###response: Yes.

"[SOC]###context: Helicobacter pylori (H.  pylori) infection is reported to be associated with many extragastrointestinal manifestations, such as hematological diseases [idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and unexplained iron deficiency anemia (IDA)], cardiovascular diseases (ischemic heart diseases), neurological disorders (stroke, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease), obesity and skin disorders.  Helicobacter pylori infection contributes to high risk of ischemic stroke: evidence from a meta-analysis.  This meta-analysis indicated that chronic H.  pylori infection was significantly associated with an increased risk of IS, especially for non-cardioembolic IS.   In the last years, a considerable number of studies have been performed on the relationship between infection from Helicobacter Pylori and atherosclerotic diseases, like stroke and ischemic heart disease.   However, there are conflicting results on the relevance of chronic infection by Helicobacter pylori as a risk factor for ischemic stroke.  CONCLUSIONS: This case-control study does not reveal any strong association between chronic Helicobacter pylori infection and ischemic stroke.   Case-control and prospective studies indicate that chronic infections, such as periodontitis, chronic bronchitis and infection with Helicobacter pylori, Chlamydia pneumoniae or Cytomegalovirus, might increase stroke risk, although considerable variation exists in the results of these studies, and methodological issues regarding serological results remain unresolved.  Chronic infections, presently discussed as stroke risk factors mainly include periodontitis and infections with Helicobacter pylori (Hp) and Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cp).   CONCLUSION: H.  Pylori gastritis is not independently associated with increased risk for stroke.   CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that CagA-seropositive strains infection is significantly associated with susceptibility to ischemic strokes and coronary heart diseases.   BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggested an association between CagA-positive H.  pylori strains and ischemic stroke.   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that CagA-positive strains of H.  pylori are significantly associated to atherosclerotic stroke.  We concluded that H pylori infection is common in DM and seems to be linked to the presence of atherosclerosis and ischemic cerebrovascular stroke.   Interesting results show that H.  pylori infection affects atherosclerosis and is weakly associated with ischemic heart disease and stroke.  Moreover, CagA-positive H.  pylori strains may play a role in the natural history of atherosclerotic stroke.  Interestingly, the majority of the extradigestive-related literature is focused on two vascular manifestations: stroke and ischemic heart disease.   Chronic infectious diseases that may increase the risk of stroke include periodontitis, chronic bronchitis and infections with microbial antigens, such as Helicobacter pylori and Chlamydia pneumoniae.   CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that H.  pylori infection is a risk factor for ischemic stroke and that CD14 polymorphism is not.   CONCLUSIONS: Our case-control study provides evidence of an association between the immune response to H.  pylori , a marker of prior infection with this organism and noncardioembolic ischemic stroke.  Case-control studies and a few prospective studies have indicated that chronic infections may add to the risk of stroke and that acute infections may act as trigger factors for stroke.  Such chronic infections include periodontal disease, infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae or Helicobacter pylori, and chronic bronchitis Chronic H.  pylori infection still showed an overall association with ischemic stroke (odds ratio for all subtypes combined: 2. 57; 95% CI: 1. 09-6. 08) after adjusting for major cardiovascular risk factors.  These results suggest that chronic H.  pylori infection may be a triggering factor that increases the risk of acute ischemic stroke.  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Studies on Helicobacter pylori infection and risk of ischemic stroke yielded variable results.   CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis of an association between infection with CagA-positive H.  pylori strains and acute cerebral ischemia.   Chronic infections (eg, infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae or Helicobacter pylori) were found to increase the risk of stroke; however, study results are at variance, residual confounding is not excluded, and causality is not established at present.   CONCLUSIONS: Infection with Helicobacter pylori is associated with an increased risk of stroke and increased fibrinogen levels but these findings can be attributed to a confounding effect of socio-economic status.   CONCLUSIONS: Hp infection represents risk factor of ischemic stoke via an interaction of Hp cytotoxins or cytokines with atherosclerotic plaques in carotic arteries.  CONCLUSIONS: The association between H pylori and acute cerebrovascular disease seems to be due to a higher prevalence of more virulent H pylori strains in patients with atherosclerotic stroke.  CONCLUSIONS: H.  pylori infection appears to be significantly more frequent in middle-aged patients with acute ischemic stroke than in controls.  Chronic H pylori infection was associated with a higher risk of stroke caused by small-artery occlusion (adjusted odds ratio, 3. 31; 95% CI, 1. 15 to 9. 56) and a lower risk of cardioembolic stroke (adjusted odds ratio, 0. 21; 95% CI, 0. 06 to 0. 71).  Overall, elevated H pylori as well as elevated C pneumoniae antibodies were not associated with ischemic stroke.  Presently, it is insufficiently established whether Helicobacter pylori infection represents a risk factor for ischemic stroke.   H.  pylori seropositivity may be an independent risk factor for stroke of atherothrombotic origin.  Appropriately randomized studies employing an antibiotic treatment for patients affected by ischemic vascular disease will answer the question of whether H.  pylori has a causal role in the pathogenesis of acute myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke.  Results on the association between this bacterium and acute myocardial infarction or stroke are controversial, due to the degree of studies heterogeneity.   Interventional randomized studies employing an antibiotic treatment for patients affected by ischemic vascular diseases will rapidly answer the question of wheather Helicobacter pylori has a causal role in the pathogenesis of acute myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke.   CONCLUSION: Chronic H pylori infection is an independent risk factor for ischaemic cerebrovascular disease and may act, at least in part, by increasing atherosclerosis.  Presently, it is insufficiently established whether Helicobacter pylori infection represents a risk factor for ischemic stroke.  This case-control study does not reveal any strong association between chronic Helicobacter pylori infection and ischemic stroke.  However, there are conflicting results on the relevance of chronic infection by Helicobacter pylori as a risk factor for ischemic stroke.

Presently, it is insufficiently established whether Helicobacter pylori infection represents a risk factor for ischemic stroke Chronic infectious diseases that may increase the risk of stroke include periodontitis, chronic bronchitis and infections with microbial antigens, such as Helicobacter pylori and Chlamydia pneumoniae Studies on Helicobacter pylori infection and risk of ischemic stroke yielded variable results Presently, it is insufficiently established whether Helicobacter pylori infection represents a risk factor for ischemic stroke However, there are conflicting results on the relevance of chronic infection by Helicobacter pylori as a risk factor for ischemic stroke
###question: Does helicobacter pylori infection increase risk for ischemic stroke?[EOC] [SOR]###response: Findings regarding association between helicobacter pylori infection and ischemic stroke risk are conflicting.  There is evidence to suggest that helicobacter pylori infection is associated with increased risk for ischemic stroke and should be considered stroke risk factors.

"[SOC]###context: The N-degron protein degradation strategy for investigating the function of essential genes We developed a dormant N-degron that can be attached to the N-terminus of a protein of interest.  Upon expression of a site-specific protease, the dormant N-degron becomes deprotected.  The N-degron then targets itself and the attached protein for rapid proteasomal degradation through the N-end rule pathway.    We describe small molecule-assisted shutoff (SMASh), a technique in which proteins are fused to a degron that removes itself in the absence of drug, resulting in the production of an untagged protein.  The auxin-inducible degron harbors great potential for dynamic protein depletion in yeast We fused two degron components into a single molecule to create a fusion protein comprising ubiquitin and Rpn4-derived unstructured region.  Functioning as a protein degron, the cellular IAP leader dramatically shortened the life span of a long-lived viral IAP (Op-IAP3) when fused to its N terminus.  The SfIAP degron contains mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK)-like regulatory sites, responsible for MAPK inhibitor-sensitive phosphorylation of SfIAP.  Hyperphosphorylation correlated with increased SfIAP turnover independent of the E3 ubiquitin-ligase activity of the SfIAP RING, which also regulated IAP stability.   We conferred such multidimensional controls to diverse Cas9 systems by leveraging small-molecule-regulated protein degron domains.  The degron mediated protein degradation represents a rapidly tunable methodology to control protein abundance, which has broad application in therapeutics and cellular function control and monitoring.  The N-end rule pathway is a ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic system, in which destabilizing N-terminal residues of short-lived proteins function as an essential determinant of an N-terminal degradation signal (N-degron).  Degrons are the elements that are used by E3 ubiquitin ligases to target proteins for degradation.  A 'distributed degron' allows regulated entry into the ER degradation pathway. 
###question: What is the function of a protein degron?[EOC] [SOR]###response: Protein degrons are part of the DNA damage response triggered by dysfunctional transcription factors.   Proteins that are destined for proteasome-mediated degradation are usually tagged with a chain of ubiquitin linked via lysine residues that targets them to the proteolytic machinery.  Disruption of one degron by a RNA-binding protein causes it to become ubiquitinated, dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus. [EOR]"
"[SOC]###context: Sperm segregation analysis of a (13;22) Robertsonian translocation carrier by FISH: a comparison of locus-specific probe and whole chromosome painting.  The t(13;22) Robertsonian translocation constitutes a rare form of rearrangement between acrocentric human chromosomes.  Most of the meiotic segregation studies of human Robertsonian translocations have been performed on common t(13;14) and t(14;21) translocations.   Robertsonian translocations (ROBs) are the most common chromosomal rearrangements in humans.  ROBs are whole-arm rearrangements between the acrocentric chromosomes 13-15, 21, and 22.  ROBs can be classified into two groups depending on their frequency of occurrence, common (rob(13q14q) and rob(14q21q)), and rare (all remaining possible nonhomologous combinations).   Robertsonian translocations (ROBs) are the most common rearrangements in humans, contributing significantly to genetic imbalance, fetal wastage, mental retardation and birth defects.  Rob(14q21q) and rob(13q14q), which are formed predominantly during female meiosis, comprise the majority (approximately 85%) of all ROBs.  Previous studies have shown that the breakpoints are consistently located within specific regions of the proximal short arms of chromosomes 13, 14, and 21.   To localize the chAB4 sequences more precisely on the acrocentrics, chAB4-specific probes together with rDNA and a number of satellite sequences were hybridized to metaphase chromosomes of normal probands and of carriers of Robertsonian translocations of the frequent types rob(13q14q) and rob(14q21q).   Chromosome 22, most probably, is the only chromosome where chAB4 is found in the direct neighbourhood of the centromere.  Fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses of metaphase chromosomes of carriers of rob(21q22q) revealed breakpoint diversity for this rare type of Robertsonian translocation chromosome.   This process is suggested for the evolution of an alpha satellite subfamily recently found on chromosomes 13, 14 and 21.  The presence of this alpha subfamily may allow pairing between these chromosomes leading to the observed non-random participation of these chromosomes in t(13q14q) and t(14q21q) Robertsonian translocations.  The pattern of association of acrocentric chromosomes was examined in ten and five carriers of a 15/21 and a 13/14 Robertsonian translocation, respectively, and was compared with that of the same numbers of relatives with normal karyotypes.  Homologous alpha satellite sequences on human acrocentric chromosomes with selectivity for chromosomes 13, 14 and 21: implications for recombination between nonhomologues and Robertsonian translocations.  Out of 21 structural chromosomal anomalies and polymorphic variants, six deletions and microdeletions, four situations with abnormal long ""p"" arm of acrocentric chromosomes, two duplications, two reciprocal translocations, two inversions, two additions, one Robertsonian translocation associating trisomy 13, one 9q heteromorphism and one complex chromosome rearrangement were noticed The purpose of this study was to search for cytologic evidence of robertsonian translocation formation that involves chromosomes 14q and 21q in human oogenesis with the use of dual color fluorescent in situ hybridization with whole chromosome paints.

"[SOC]###context: Some of these proteins are of outstanding interest in the biology and clinical management of this disease, such as CD44 and PARP1.  We present here our results, including a large cumulative database of proteins based on the analysis of 78 TNBCs, and the identification and validation of one specific protein, Mage-A4, which was expressed in a significant fraction of TNBC and Her2-positive/ER negative lesions.  Proteomic profiling of triple-negative breast carcinomas in combination with a three-tier orthogonal technology approach identifies Mage-A4 as potential therapeutic target in estrogen receptor negative breast cancer.  Further, we performed comparative quantitative proteomic and gene array analyses of these cells and identified potential novel markers of breast cancer cells with tumor-initiating features, such as lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR), RAB25, S100A14 and mucin 1 (MUC1), as well as a novel 31-gene signature capable of predicting distant metastasis in cohorts of estrogen receptor-negative human breast cancers.  he results identify Hsp90 as a critical and multimodal target in this most difficult to treat breast cancer subtype and support the use of the Hsp90 inhibitor PU-H71 for clinical trials involving patients with TNBC.  We obtained differential expression patterns for several glycolytic enzymes (as for example MDH2, PGK1, TKT, Aldolase1), cytokeratins (CK7, 8, 9, 14, 17, 19), further structure proteins (vimentin, fibronectin, L-plastin), for NME1-NME2, lactoferrin, and members of the Annexin family.  he expression of calreticulin, cellular retinoic acid-binding protein II, chloride intracellular channel protein 1, EF-1-beta, galectin 1, peroxiredoxin-2, platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor, protein disulfide isomerase and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 5 were further validated using a tissue microarray containing 70 malignant breast carcinomas of various grades of atypia.  The first is characterized by high expression of Stat1, Mx1, and CD74.  This effect was accompanied with a marked increase in the membrane expression of beta-catenin, MUC18, plexins, integrins, and other proteins involved in cell adhesion and cancer metastasis.  Taken together, our results show that Stat1/CD74 positive triple-negative tumors are more aggressive and suggest an approach for development of better diagnostics and more targeted therapies for triple negative breast cancer.  Proteomic analysis also identified high levels of IDH2 and CRABP2 and low levels of SEC14L2 to be prognostic markers for overall breast cancer survival.  Proteomic and validation immunohistochemical analyses revealed that alpha-defensins (DEFA) were overexpressed in tumors from patients with a pCR.  The expression of a selected group of high abundance and/or breast cancer-specific potential biomarkers including thromobospondin 1, galectin-3 binding protein, cathepsin D, vimentin, zinc-α2-glycoprotein, CD44, and EGFR from the breast cancer cell lines and in their culture media were further validated by Western blot analysis.  his provided novel evidence for PMA regulation of the enzymes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, nucleolar RNA helicase 2 and Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M.  Among them, we identify downregulation of components of the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway and G(2)-M phase to contribute to its anti-proliferative effect, degradation of activated Akt and Bcl-xL to induce apoptosis, and inhibition of activated NF-kappaB, Akt, ERK2, Tyk2, and PKC to reduce TNBC invasive potential.

In this study, we firstly have examined this punctate pattern of Sam68 re-localization in the cytoplasm, and observed the obvious recruitments of Sam68 to the EV71-induced stress granules (SGs) Stress granules (SGs) are cytoplasmic granules that are formed in cells when stress occurs.  Proteins that contain a functional Z-DNA-binding domain localize to cytoplasmic stress granules.  We have previously shown that ADAR1(p150) localized to cytoplasmic stress granules in HeLa cells following either oxidative or interferon-induced stress .  We also show that oxidative stress recruits mutant FUS to cytoplasmic stress granules where it is able to bind and sequester wild-type FUS.   Sequestration of highly expressed mRNAs in cytoplasmic granules, P-bodies, and stress granules enhances cell viability.

Teriparatide reverses the structural damage seen in osteoporosis and restores the structure of trabecular bone.  It has a positive effect on cortical bone, and any early increases in cortical porosity appear to be offset by increases in cortical thickness and diameter.  Teriparatide (recombinant human 1-34 parathyroid hormone) is used to treat women with menopausal osteoporosis and men at high risk for fractures.  .  A new class of drugs called anabolic agents, typified by teriparatide usher, has the potential to reconstitute destroyed bone and bring it to its pristine state.   Teriparatide [PTH (1-34)] is a genetically engineered analog of human parathyroid hormone that acts as an anabolic drug by increasing activity in both osteoblasts and osteoclasts.  Teriparatide (recombinant human parathyroid hormone ) is an anabolic agent approved for the treatment of patients at high risk for fracture.  Teriparatide promotes bone formation, while bisphosphonates suppress bone resorption.

"[SOC]###context: NT-pro-BNP was significantly elevated postexercise in both adults and adolescents and remained above baseline at 24 h in both groups.  NT-pro-BNP concentrations increased significantly (28 +/- 17. 1 vs 795 +/- 823 ng x L, P < 0. 05), whereas postrace cTnT were elevated in just five athletes (20%).  [NT-pro-BNP] was observed immediately after the marathon (median [NT-pro-BNP] before: 39. 6 pg ml(-1), after: 138. 6 pg ml(-1), p=0. 003) with a further increase on day one.  [BNP] did not increase immediately after the marathon but increased on day one (median [BNP] before: 15 pg ml(-1), day one: 27. 35 pg ml(-1), p=0. 006).  Pro-BNP was significantly increased immediately post-race (27+/-21 vs 7+/-2 pmol/L pre-race, P < or = 0. 007), which 12-24 h later, decreased to 19+/-14 pmol/L (P = 0. 07 vs pre-race).  The relatively high NT-proBNP levels after active recovery when psychophysical stress is higher, because of cycling and cold water immersion, suggest that not only endurance exercise, but also strenuous, stressful short exercise can induce an increase in NT-proBNP concentrations.  Running a marathon significantly increases NT-pro-BNP levels in healthy adults.  This increase could be partially attributed to cardiac stress.  Increases in NT-proBNP can be found in a major part of obviously healthy athletes after prolonged strenuous exercise.  The release of BNP during and after exercise may not result from myocardial damage but may have cytoprotective and growth-regulating effects.  The different nature of exercise-induced increases in BNP and cardiac troponins has to be elucidated in the future.  In healthy cyclists, transient increases in NT-pro-BNP and cTnT are more likely to reflect cardiac fatigue than injury.  The rise in BNP in older athletes may reflect a reversible, mainly diastolic left ventricular dysfunction.   Plasma BNP concentrations were higher in both the judo and marathon groups than in controls, and positively correlated with LV mass as well as with deceleration time.  Such exercise significantly increased ANP and BNP levels in healthy men, and the increases could be partially attributed to myocardial damage during the race.

"[SOC]###context: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis, for which mainstream treatments have not changed for decades.  To identify additional therapeutic targets in AML, we optimize a genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screening platform and use it to identify genetic vulnerabilities in AML cells.  We identify 492 AML-specific cell-essential genes, including several established therapeutic targets such as DOT1L, BCL2, and MEN1, and many other genes including clinically actionable candidates.  We validate selected genes using genetic and pharmacological inhibition, and chose KAT2A as a candidate for downstream study.  KAT2A inhibition demonstrated anti-AML activity by inducing myeloid differentiation and apoptosis, and suppressed the growth of primary human AMLs of diverse genotypes while sparing normal hemopoietic stem-progenitor cells.

"[SOC]###context: Moreover, we found that the temporal transcription factor (TTF) Eyeless/Pax6 regulates the development of two recurrently-connected CX subtypes: Eyeless (ey) is one of the most critical transcription factors for initiating the entire eye development in Drosophila.  ax6 transcription factors are essential upstream regulators in the developing anterior brain and peripheral visual system of most bilaterian animals.  While a single homolog is in charge of these functions in vertebrates, two Pax6 genes are in Drosophila: eyeless (ey) and twin of eyeless (toy)  Eye development in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is driven by the highly conserved selector gene network referred to as the ""retinal determination gene network,"" composed of approximately 20 factors, whose core comprises twin of eyeless (toy), eyeless (ey), sine oculis (so), dachshund (dac), and eyes absent (eya).  These genes encode transcriptional regulators that are each necessary for normal eye development Mutational analysis of the eyeless gene and phenotypic rescue reveal that an intact Eyeless protein is necessary for normal eye and brain development in Drosophila.  Loss of Pax 6 function leads to an eyeless phenotype in both mammals and insects, and ectopic expression of both the Drosophila and the mouse gene leads to the induction of ectopic eyes in Drosophila, which suggested to us that Pax 6 might be a universal master control gene for eye morphogenesis.  These data, along with the phenotypes observed in the four newly characterized eyeless alleles, demonstrate the requirement for an intact Eyeless protein for normal Drosophila eye and brain development.  The Pax6 genes eyeless (ey) and twin of eyeless (toy) are upstream regulators in the retinal determination gene network (RDGN), which instructs the formation of the adult eye primordium in Drosophila.  In Drosophila, two Pax6 genes function in a pathway in which twin of eyeless (toy) directly regulates eyeless (ey), which is necessary for initiating the eye developmental pathway.  this, we present evidence that eyeless (ey), which encodes the Drosophila homolog of Pax-6, directly regulates rhodopsin 1 (rh1) expression in the photoreceptor cells.  We detect ey expressi The Drosophila compound eye is specified by the simultaneous and interdependent activity of transcriptional regulatory genes from four families: PAX6 (eyeless, twin of eyeless, eyegone), EYA (eyes absent), SIX (sine oculis, Optix) and DACH (dachshund).  Mammals hav We describe here the role of the transcription factors encoding genes tailless (tll), atonal (ato), sine oculis (so), eyeless (ey) and eyes absent (eya), and EGFR signaling in establishing the Drosophila embryonic visual system.  The embryon The eyeless, dachshund, and eyes absent genes encode conserved, nuclear proteins that are essential for eye development in Drosophila.  The Drosophila homologue of Pax6, eyeless, is also necessary for correct invertebrate eye development, and its misexpression leads to formation of ectopic eyes in Drosophila.  Differential expression and function of the Drosophila Pax6 genes eyeless and twin of eyeless in embryonic central nervous system development.  The eyeless homeodomain is dispensable for eye development in Drosophila.  eyeless (ey) is a key regulator of the eye development pathway in Drosophila.  Previous work has demonstrated the existence of a functional network and genetic regulatory hierarchy in Drosophila in which eyeless (ey, the Pax6 orthologue), eyes absent (eya), and dac operate together to regulate Drosophila eye development, and that ey regulates the expression of eya and dac.  Drosophila Pax-6/eyeless is essential for normal adult brain structure and function.  A combination of bioinformatics, comparative expression profiling and microarray-based epistasis experiments has recently identified new targets of Eyeless, a key transcription factor in Drosophila retinal determination.  In 1995, the eyeless (ey) gene was dubbed the ""master-regulator"" of eye development in Drosophila.  eyeless, which encodes a Pax6 transcription factor, is expressed early in progenitors and controls aspects of this cell migration.  The Drosophila gene eyeless (ey) encodes a transcription factor with both a paired domain and a homeodomain.  Eye specification in Drosophila is thought be controlled by a set of seven nuclear factors that includes the Pax6 homolog, Eyeless.  A role for the Pax-6 homologue eyeless in adult Drosophila brain development and function is described.  We show that several binding sites are required for the eye specific expression, and, therefore, we propose a Pax-6-like molecule to be a positive transactivator for the eye specific ey expression.  In Drosophila eyeless and twin of eyeless, play non-redundant roles in the developing retina.  Members of one subclass, Pax6, function as selector genes and play key roles in the retinal development of all seeing animals.  The identification of both transcriptional activator and repressor activity within the Pax6 protein furthers our understanding of how this gene family regulates tissue determination.  eyeless induces much larger ectopic eyes, at higher frequencies, and in a broader range of tissues than twin of eyeless.  Pax genes encode DNA binding proteins that play pivotal roles in the determination of complex tissues.  The Drosophila Pax-6 gene eyeless (ey) plays a key role in eye development.  The two Pax6 gene homologs eyeless and twin of eyeless play decisive early roles in Drosophila eye development.

During development, proliferation of cerebellar granule neuron precursors (CGNP), candidate cells-of-origin for the pediatric brain tumor medulloblastoma, requires signaling by Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF), the pathways of which are also implicated in medulloblastoma.  Sonic hedgehog and insulin-like growth factor signaling synergize to induce medulloblastoma formation from nestin-expressing neural progenitors in mice.  Ectopic expression of alpha and beta interferons in the developing brain also induces Shh-mediated medulloblastoma formation, suggesting a possible role for antiviral response in the genesis of medulloblastoma.  Aberrant activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) and Wnt developmental pathways is associated with medulloblastoma, but deregulation of other molecular pathways, including insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling, has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of the tumor.

At the SUMO-1 labelled areas, the presence of HP1alpha protein, as well as of trimethylated H3-K9 and H4-K20 histone modifications, supports a role for SUMO-1 in constitutive heterochromatin organization.  Surprisingly, the marsupial Xi was stably enriched for modifications associated with constitutive heterochromatin in all eukaryotes (H4K20me3, H3K9me3).  Constitutive heterochromatin during mouse oogenesis: the pattern of histone H3 modifications and localization of HP1alpha and HP1beta proteins.  In fission yeast, heterochromatin formation requires RNAi and the histone H3K9 methyltransferase complex CLRC, composed of Clr4, Raf1, Raf2, Cul4, and Rik1.   Methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3-Lys9) by site-specific histone methyltransferases (Suv39h HMTases) marks constitutive heterochromatin.   H3S10 phosphorylation marks constitutive heterochromatin during interphase in early mouse embryos until the 4-cell stage.  In placental mammals non-coding XIST RNA triggers silencing of one X (Xi) and recruits a characteristic suite of epigenetic modifications, including the histone mark H3K27me3. 
###question: Which post-translational histone modifications are characteristic of constitutive heterochromatin?[EOC] [SOR]###response: H3K9me3 is the major marker of constitutive heterochromatin.  Other histone methylation marks usually found in constitutive heterochromatin, are H4K20me3 and H3K79me3.  Classical histone modifications associated with heterochromatin include H3K9me2, H3K27me1 and H3K27me2.  Histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 36 is associated with constitutive and facultative heterochromatin.  H3S10 phosphorylation marks constitutive heterochromatin during interphase in early mouse embryos until the 4-cell stage[EOR]"

BACKGROUND A1c, a surrogate measure of glycemic control, is known to have a strong linear correlation with mean plasma glucose (MPG) when analyzed in populations of patients.  Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) has been used by clinicians as a means to measure short to intermediate term glucose control in diabetics.   To estimate the impact of increased glycated hemoglobin (A1C) monitoring and treatment intensification for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) on quality measures and reimbursement within the Medicare Advantage Star (MA Star) program.  Hemoglobin A1c (A1c) was recently added to the diagnostic criteria for diabetes and prediabetes.  AIMS: The purpose of this study was to develop a measure of psychosocial barriers to adherence in adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and examine relationships to patient characteristics, adherence, and hemoglobin A1C (A1C).  To compare the ability of alternative wait time measures to predict glycated hemoglobin (A1C) levels among diabetes patients.  Chronic complications of diabetes can be reduced through optimal glycemic and lipid control as evaluated through measurement of glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)  The assessment of glycemic control, most commonly using glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C), has been a major measure for care of patients with diabetes.   Glycated haemoglobin, as measured by haemoglobin A1C (A1C), c Hemoglobin A1c is the measurement of glycated hemoglobin and can aid in both the diagnosis and continued management of diabetes mellitus Diabetes treatment trials intended to seek indications for glycemic control are facilitated by the regulatory acceptance of glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) as a validated intermediate efficacy end point Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c or simply A1c) is a measure of a long-term blood plasma glucose average, a reliable index to reflect one's diabetic condition.

"[SOC]###context: She was subsequently diagnosed with hypochondroplasia at the age of 6 years when disproportional short stature, stocky habitus and macrocephaly were observed.  These phenotypic findings were later confirmed by the presence of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene mutation N540K.  Achondroplasia can be diagnosed by characteristic clinical and radiographic findings in most affected individuals.  In individuals who may be too young to diagnose with certainty or in individuals with atypical findings, molecular genetic testing can be used to detect a mutation in FGFR3.  Achondroplasia comes from the genetic point mutations in the fibroblastic growth factor receptor 3 gene (FGFR3), which enables abnormal cartilage growth-plate differentiation and insufficient bony development.  The most common genetic mutations in this receptor are G to A at position 1138 (G1138A), which result in the substitution of glycine to arginine at codon 380.  To investigate the mutation at the transmembrane domain of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) nucleotide 1138 site for identifying the major pathologic mechanism of achondroplasia (ACH) and to evaluate the efficacy of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis(DGGE) method for screening the point mutations.   Nucleotide 1138 in transmembrane domain of FGFR3 gene is the hot point for mutation in ACH and hence its major pathologic cause.   The nucleotide 1138 of FGFR3 gene is also the hotspot of mutation in Chinese patients with ACH.  A simple and rapid molecular diagnostic method has been set up to differentiate ACH from other similar genetic dwarfism.  The diagnosis of achondroplasia was based on the presence of clinical and radiographic findings and confirmed by the presence of a common FGFR3 gene mutation (Gly380Arg) detected by restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction products.  All patients carried the same glycine-to-arginine mutation at codon 380(G380R) of the transmembrane domain of FGFR3.   The results suggest that the G380R mutation of FGFR3 is also a frequent mutation causing achondroplasia in Chinese.  Detecting FGFR 3 gene mutation with PCR-SSCP and restriction enzymes analysis is a convenient, rapid and reliable molecular diagnostic assay for prenatal and early diagnosis of achondroplasia.  To evaluate whether mutation in the exon 10 of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3(FGFR3) gene in common in Chinese patients with achondroplasia.  Achondroplasia (ACH) is the most frequent form of short-limb dwarfism.  Recently, the gene mutation responsible for ACH has been identified in the transmembrane domain of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene.  The cause of ACH is a point mutation at nucleotide 1138 of the cDNA, resulting in the substitution of an arginine residue for a glycine.   Recent studies mapped the achondroplasia gene on chromosome region 4p16. 3 and identified a common mutation in the gene encoding the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3).  
###question: Mutation of which gene is associated with Achondroplasia?[EOC] [SOR]###response: Achondroplasia is due to mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. [EOR]"
"[SOC]###context: In the phase III PACIFIC trial consolidation with durvalumab, an anti-PDL-1 antibody, was associated with survival benefit in patients diagnosed with LA-NSCLC who responded to concurrent chemoradiotherapy.  Ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) is the godfather of checkpoint inhibitors, whereas several blocking monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-1 (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and PD-L1 (atezolizumab, durvalumab, avelumab, and BMS-946559) have been developed.  DATA SYNTHESIS: Atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab have demonstrated clinical efficacy with tolerable toxicities in patients with metastatic UC with disease progression following platinum-based chemotherapy.  Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies may provide overall survival advantage; these are currently being evaluated in ongoing phase 3 studies.   METHODS: An electronic literature search was performed of public databases (MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica dataBASE [EMBASE], and Cochrane) and conference proceedings for trials using PD-1 inhibitors (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and PD-L1 inhibitors (atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab) in patients with NSCLC.  A formal systematic analysis was conducted with Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (version 2. 2).  Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are a key component of treating advanced cancer patients, principally antibodies against CTLA-4 and PD-1 or PD-L1.  Durvalumab (MEDI4736) is a selective, high-affinity, human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that blocks PD-L1, which binds to PD-1 and CD80, but not to PD-L2.  However, it is still unknown how atezolizumab and durvalumab specifically recognize PD-L1, although this is important for investigating novel binding sites on PD-L1 targeted by other therapeutic antibodies for the design and improvement of anti-PD-L1 agents.  Here, we report the crystal structures of PD-L1 in complex with atezolizumab and durvalumab to elucidate the precise epitopes involved and the structural basis for PD-1/PD-L1 blockade by these antibodies.  In 2016 and 2017, monoclonal antibodies targeting PD-L1, including atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab, were approved by the FDA for the treatment of multiple advanced cancers.  We hypothesize the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor, durvalumab, olaparib, or cediranib combinations are tolerable and active in recurrent women's cancers.  Combination treatment with the anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab and the anti-CTLA-4 antibody tremelimumab might provide greater antitumour activity than either drug alone.  Durvalumab (MEDI4736) is a high-affinity human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-1 and CD80, blocking PD-L1, but not PD-L2.  The Food and Drug Administration has already approved a number of checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) monoclonal antibodies including ipilimumab; anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies including nivolumab and pembrolizumab; anti-PD-L1 antibodies including atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab.  Durvalumab is a human IgG1-K monoclonal antibody that targets programmed death ligand 1 and is approved by the U. S.  Food and Drug Administration for locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer and locally advanced, unresectable stage 3 non-small cell lung cancer.  Other notable PD-L1 inhibitors under development include avelumab and durvalumab.  Combining the anti-PD-L1 antibody durvalumab and the anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 antibody tremelimumab offers the potential for antitumor activity in patients with advanced NSCLC, regardless of PD-L1 tumor status.  Five antibodies targeting the programmed cell death protein 1--programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-1--PD-L1) pathway have been approved by the U. S.  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the management of various malignancies: pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab and avelumab.  Currently, the only FDA-approved indication for the anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody durvalumab (MEDI-4736) is locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma that has progressed during or following platinum-based chemotherapy within 12 months of treatment.  Intravenous durvalumab (Imfinzi™; AstraZeneca) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks programmed cell death ligand-1 binding to its receptors (PD-1 and CD80), resulting in enhanced T-cell responses against cancer cells.  Here, we report a meta-analysis investigating the safety and efficacy of durvalumab (MEDI4736), an inhibitor of PD-L1, in various solid tumors.

Commotio cordis due to blunt trauma to the precordium is a rare cause of death in young athletes, occurring less frequently than all of the other athletics-related deaths.  Commotio cordis is a term used to describe cases of blunt thoracic impact causing fatality without structural damage of the heart and internal organs.   Although blunt, nonpenetrating chest blows causing sudden cardiac death (commotio cordis) are often associated with competitive sports, dangers implicit in such blows can extend into many other life activities.   Sudden death following blunt chest trauma is a frightening occurrence known as 'commotio cordis' or 'concussion of the heart'.  Commotio cordis is a term used to describe cases of blunt thoracic impact causing fatality without gross structural damage of the heart and internal organs.   Cardiac concussion, previously known as commotio cordis, occurs in structurally normal hearts without gross or microscopic injury to the myocardium, cardiac valves, or coronary arteries, as opposed to other sports-related deaths known to occur more frequently in structural or congenital heart disease.

"[SOC]###context: N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide levels as a predictor of functional outcomes in patients with ischemic stroke.  There was a strong positive correlation between the plasma level of NT-proBNP and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (r=0. 415, P=0. 000).  Plasma levels of NT-proBNP in patients with an unfavorable outcome were significantly higher than those in patients with a favorable outcome [3432 (interquartile range, 1100-54991) vs.  978 (interquartile range, 123-1705) pg/ml; P=0. 000].  In multivariate analyses, after adjusting for all other significant outcome predictors, the NT-proBNP level that remained can be seen as an independent unfavorable outcome predictor, with an adjusted odds ratios of 4. 14 (95% confidence interval, 2. 72-7. 99; P=0. 000).  Our results show that plasma NT-proBNP levels were significantly elevated in patients with an unfavorable outcome and might be of clinical importance as a supplementary tool for the assessment of functional outcomes in patients with AIS.  Plasma levels of BNP, NT-proBNP, cortisol and copeptin were associated with stroke severity, as well as short-term functional outcomes.  After adjusting for all other significant outcome predictors, NT-proBNP, cortisol and copeptin remained as independent outcome predictors.  In the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the biomarker panel (including BNP, NT-proBNP, cortisol and copeptin) predicted functional outcome and death within 90 days significantly more efficiently than the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) or the biomarker alone.  The NT-proBNP levels were significantly higher at 4 intervals after ischemic stroke than in healthy and at-risk control subjects (all p<0. 001).   Multivariate analysis demonstrated that age and NIH Stroke Scale were the 2 strongest independent predictors of increased NT-proBNP levels (all p<0. 01).  Furthermore, increased NT-proBNP (> or = 150 pg/ml) was the strongest independent predictor of long-term (mean follow-up: 24 months) UFCO (26 patients) (all p<0. 05).  CONCLUSIONS: The NT-proBNP level was markedly elevated after acute ischemic stroke and declined substantially thereafter.  An increased NT-proBNP level was strongly and independently correlated with UFCO in patients after ischemic stroke.

Only a minority of stem cells expressed nestin, a marker for neural precursor cells.  In addition, bone marrow transplantation promoted proliferation of ependymal and subependymal cells, identified by nestin (a neuroepithelial stem cell marker), within the ventricular zone and subventricular zone (VZ/SVZ).  The results indicate that administration of thyroid hormone and retinoic acid increases the expression of Ki67, a nuclear antigen associated with cell proliferation, and of nestin, a marker protein for precursor cells in the subventricular zone of adult male rats In all animals, 20-40% of the newly generated cells in the dentate gyrus and subventricular zone expressed the neural progenitor cell markers Musashi1 or Nestin

"[SOC]###context: patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma.  BRAF-mutated melanoma  The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway has been reported to be activated in over 80% of all cutaneous melanomas, making it the focus of many scientific studies in the melanoma field.  Discoveries of mutations and aberrant expression of components in this cascade, in particular, BRAF and NRAS render a deeper understanding of the mechanisms responsible for oncogenesis and provide new therapeutic strategies for this deadly disease.    BRAF-targeted therapies (e. g. , vemurafenib, dabrafenib) have showed impressive results in systemic therapy for melanoma harboring activating BRAF V600E mutations.    An independent cohort of 91 archival MUPs was also screened for 46 hot spot mutations highly prevalent in melanoma including BRAF, NRAS, KIT, GNAQ, and GNA11.   a high rate of BRAF (45 of 101, 45%) and NRAS (32 of 101, 32%) mutations, collectively indicating a mutation profile consistent with cutaneous sun-exposed melanomas.  Treatment of advanced melanoma has been improved with the advent of the BRAF inhibitors.  BRAF is the most prevalent oncogene and an important therapeutic target in melanoma.  Activating BRAF mutations, leading to constitutive activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, are common in a variety of human cancers.  Several small molecule BRAF inhibitors have been developed during the last years and shown promising results in clinical trials, especially for metastatic melanoma, while they have been less effective in colon cancer.   BRAF mutations have emerged as an important predictive biomarker for metastasized melanoma.   BRAF V600 selective inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of V600 mutation positive metastatic melanoma,  BRAF(V600) mutation-positive melanoma  Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer.  The treatment of patients with advanced melanoma is rapidly evolving due to an improved understanding of molecular drivers of this disease.  Somatic mutations in BRAF are the most common genetic alteration found in these tumors.   genetically activated BRAF, is now commonly prescribed for metastatic melanoma harboring a BRAF mutation.  BRAF inhibitors improve melanoma patient survival, but resistance invariably develops.   BRAF inhibitors elicit rapid antitumor responses in the majority of patients with BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma, but acquired drug resistance is almost universal.   Most patients with BRAF(V600)-mutant metastatic melanoma develop resistance to selective RAF kinase inhibitors.   BRAF(V600E) mutation confers constitutive BRAK kinase activation in melanoma cells, promoting tumor growth.  This discovery led to the development of BRAF kinase inhibitors like vemurafenib and dabrafenib.   (V600)BRAF mutation was identified as an ideal target for clinical therapy due to its indispensable roles in supporting melanoma initiation and progression.  The Braf(V600E) mutation has been detected in patients with metastatic melanoma, colon, thyroid, and other cancers.  Since the identification of activating BRAF mutations and subsequent development of drugs targeting the mutant BRAF protein, oncologists now need to incorporate prognostic and predictive biomarkers into treatment decisions for their melanoma patient BRAF mutations occur in approximately 8% of all human cancers and approach 50% in melanoma and papillary carcinoma of thyroid.  Vemurafenib is a selective and potent small molecule inhibitor of the V600 mutant form of the BRAF protein used in the treatment of melanoma and colorectal cancer.  Molecular studies demonstrated that the melanoma was positive for the 1799T>A (V600E) mutation in the BRAF gene.  RAF kinase inhibitors have substantial therapeutic effects in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma.  An activating BRAF (V600E) kinase mutation occurs in approximately half of melanomas.   Activating mutations in the BRAF gene occur in approximately 50% of melanomas.  More than 70% of BRAF mutations are V600E and 10-30% are V600K.  Activating BRAF mutations, leading to constitutive activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, are common in a variety of human cancers.  Several small molecule BRAF inhibitors have been developed during the last years and shown promising results in clinical trials, especially for metastatic melanoma, while they have been less effective in colon cancer.   Personalized melanoma medicine has progressed from histopathologic features to serum markers to molecular profiles.  Since the identification of activating BRAF mutations and subsequent development of drugs targeting the mutant BRAF protein, oncologists now need to incorporate prognostic and predictive biomarkers into treatment decisions for their melanoma patients.  The clinical activity of BRAF inhibitor (BRAF-I) therapy is a major breakthrough in the treatment of metastatic melanoma carrying BRAF mutations.   The discovery of BRAF mutations in melanoma led to the development of BRAF inhibitors for the treatment of advanced melanoma.   BRAF represents one of the most frequently mutated protein kinase genes in human tumours.  The mutation is commonly tested in pathology practice.  BRAF mutation is seen in melanoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma (including papillary thyroid carcinoma arising from ovarian teratoma), ovarian serous tumours, colorectal carcinoma, gliomas, hepatobiliary carcinomas and hairy cell leukaemia.  Indeed, recent clinical trials involving BRAF selective inhibitors exhibited promising response rates in metastatic melanoma patients.   A majority of cutaneous melanomas show activating mutations in the NRAS or BRAF proto-oncogenes, components of the Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk (MAPK) signal transduction pathway.  The discovery of activating BRAF mutations in ∼50% of all melanomas has proved to be a turning point in the therapeutic management of the disseminated disease.  This review summarizes the critical role of BRAF in melanoma pathophysiology, the clinical and pathological determinants of BRAF mutation status and finally addresses the current state of the art of BRAF inhibitors.  To better understand the BRAF mutation profile in melanomas, we retrospectively analyzed data from 1112 primary and metastatic melanomas at our institution.  The cohort included nonacral cutaneous (n = 774), acral (n = 111), mucosal (n = 26), uveal (n = 23), leptomeningeal (n = 1), and metastatic melanomas of unknown primary site (n = 177).  BRAF mutation hotspot regions in exons 11 and 15 were analyzed by pyrosequencing or with the primer extension MassARRAY system.  A total of 499 (44. 9%) specimens exhibited BRAF mutations, involving exon 15 [497 (99. 6%)] or exon 11 [2 (0. 4%)].  p. V600E was detected in 376 (75. 4%) cases; the remaining 123 (24. 6%) cases exhibited non-p. V600E mutations, of which p. V600K was most frequent [86 (17. 2%)].  BRAF mutations were more frequent in nonacral cutaneous (51. 4%) than acral melanomas [18 (16. 2%)] (P < 0. 001); however, there was no significant difference among cutaneous histological subtypes.  All mucosal, uveal, and leptomeningeal melanomas were BRAF wild type (WT).  Recently, it was reported that BRAF mutations are frequent in melanoma.  Activating mutations in BRAF are the most common genetic alterations in melanoma.  Oncogenic BRAF and NRAS mutations are frequent in malignant melanoma.  Mutation of BRAF is now known to be common in cutaneous melanomas, and raises possible new therapeutic options of anti-RAF treatment for these patients BRAF mutations are common events in a variety of melanocytic nevi and primary cutaneous melanomas Approximately 40-60% of melanomas from Caucasian populations carry activating mutations in the BRAF oncogene, with the most common being the p. Val600Glu (V600E) hotspot mutation in exon 15 Using a cohort of 115 patients with primary invasive melanomas, we show that BRAF mutations are statistically significantly more common in melanomas occurring on skin subject to intermittent sun exposure than elsewhere (23 of 43 patients; P<. 001, two-sided Fisher's exact test) BRAF mutations have been identified as the most common oncogene mutation in melanomas, especially important in those originating on nonchronically sun-damaged skin.

"[SOC]###context: Forkhead-box class O (FoxO) transcription factors regulate mechanisms of cellular aging, including protein quality control, autophagy and defenses against oxidative stress.  Statin-mediated upregulation of klotho expression and differential regulation of FoxO expression promote resistance to CsA-induced oxidative stress.  FoxO expression suppressed the ROS-induced apoptosis in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells via the expression of ROS-scavenging enzymes.  Differential expression of FOXO1 and FOXO3a confers resistance to oxidative cell death upon endometrial decidualization.  We demonstrate that human endometrial stromal cells become extraordinarily resistant to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis upon decidualization in response to cAMP and progesterone signaling.  This differentiation process is associated with the induction of the forkhead transcription factor FOXO1, which in turn increases the expression of the mitochondrial antioxidant manganese superoxide dismutase.  Comparative analysis demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide, a source of free radicals, strongly induces FOXO3a mRNA and protein expression in undifferentiated human endometrial stromal cells but not in decidualized cells.  These results suggest that the induction of FOXO1 may enhance the ability of decidualized cells to prevent oxidative damage while the simultaneous repression of FOXO3a expression disables the signaling pathway responsible for oxidative cell death.  The differential regulation of FOXO expression provides the decidua with a robust system capable of coping with prolonged episodes of oxidative stress during pregnancy.

Two genetic models exist to explain the evolution of ageing - mutation accumulation (MA) and antagonistic pleiotropy (AP).  Under AP, late-acting deleterious mutations accumulate because they confer beneficial effects early in life.  Many marker loci responded in opposite directions to selection for late- and early-life fitness, indicating negative genetic correlations or trade-offs between those traits.

Treatment with T3 (1. 2μg/100g body weight, i. p. ) 1h after TBI resulted in a significant improvement in motor and cognitive recovery after CCI, as well as in marked reduction of lesion volumes.   Western blot analysis revealed the ability of T3 to reduce brain trauma through modulation of cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB).  Twenty-four hours after brain trauma, T3-treated mice also showed significantly lower number of TUNEL(+) apoptotic neurons and curtailed induction of Bax, compared to vehicle control.  In addition, T3 significantly enhanced the post-TBI expression of the neuroprotective neurotrophins (BDNF and GDNF) compared to vehicle.   The stimulating effect of T3 on peripheral nerve regeneration may have considerable therapeutic potential.  The present study provides evidence that the peripheral nervous system has its own system responsible for the local production of 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine, which may play a key role during the regeneration process.  Although it has been hypothesized that T3 may facilitate neuronal regeneration after CNS injury, the 5'-D2 response to brain injury is unknown.  The outcome after brain injury is closely correlated with the intensity of these changes, particularly with catecholamine plasma levels and the severity of the low triiodothyronine syndrome.  The thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and L-thyroxine appear to enhance regeneration in the peripheral and central nervous system (CNS).   T3 treatment influenced the general levels of incorporation of all treated groups over all days postoperation.  T3 effects appear to involve an increased sensitivity of the cells of the injured nervous system to the hormone.  T3, when administered over an 8 week period, stimulated axonal regeneration in the dorsal cortex and corpus callosum and promoted healing of the wound in the corpus callosum.

"[SOC]###context: Functional connectivity in the default mode network (DMN) is known to be reduced in patients with disorders of consciousness, to a different extent depending on their clinical severity.  Patients showed significant impairments in all of the pathways connecting cortical regions within this network, as well as the pathway connecting the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus with the thalamus, relative to the healthy volunteers.  Moreover, the structural integrity of this pathway, as well as that of those connecting the posterior areas of the network, was correlated with the patients' behavioral signs for awareness, being higher in EMCS patients than those in the upper and lower ranges of the MCS patients, and lowest in VS patients.  These results provide a possible neural substrate for the functional disconnection previously described in these patients, and reinforce the importance of the DMN in the genesis of awareness and the neural bases of its disorders.  Although the functional significance of the default-mode network remains a matter of debate, it has been suggested to be a candidate for the network subserving basic functions related to consciousness.  Despite resolution of corpus callosum lesion on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 1 week, the patient persistently presented disturbance of consciousness.  Resting-state functional MRI revealed that the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus was functionally disconnected from other brain regions within the default-mode network.  Our case report suggests that assessment of the functional connectivity in the resting-state default-mode network could be a useful marker of consciousness disturbance even in the presence of a reversible brain lesion.  A present and intact DMN was observed in controls and those patients who subsequently regained consciousness, but was disrupted in all patients who failed to regain consciousness.  The results suggest that the DMN is necessary but not sufficient to support consciousness.  Clinically, DMN connectivity may serve as an indicator of the extent of cortical disruption and predict reversible impairments in consciousness.  Recent studies on resting state activity in DOC, measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques, show that functional connectivity is disrupted in the task-negative or the default mode network.  This report shows for the first time, in three patients, that the persistent vegetative state (PVS) is marked by a dysfunctional default mode network, with decreased connectivity in several brain regions, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulated cortex, especially in the right hemisphere. 
###question: How functional connectivity of the default mode network changes in patients with disorders of consciousness?[EOC] [SOR]###response: Functional connectivity in the default mode network (DMN) is reduced in patients with different disorders of consciousness, and correlates with the level of consciousness.   Specifically, functional connectivity in the default mode network was shown to be absent in brain death patients, extremely low in vegetative state patients and slightly decreased in minimally conscious state patients when compared to healthy subjects.  Therefore, functional connectivity in the default mode network was suggested to be valuable in differentiating patients with different disorders of consciousness.  Clinically, functional connectivity in the default mode network was also shown to be an indicator of the extent of cortical disruption and predict reversible impairments in consciousness. [EOR]"

SNP2TFBS is a computational resource intended to support researchers investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying regulatory variation in the human genome.  The database essentially consists of a collection of text files providing specific annotations for human single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), namely whether they are predicted to abolish, create or change the affinity of one or several transcription factor (TF) binding sites.  A SNP's effect on TF binding is estimated based on a position weight matrix (PWM) model for the binding specificity of the corresponding factor.

"[SOC]###context: Materials and Methods This HIPAA-compliant, institutional review board-approved study was performed at a tertiary care, academic medical center ED with approximately 60 000 annual visits and included all patients who were suspected of having pulmonary embolism (PE) and who underwent CT pulmonary angiography between January 1, 2011, and August 31, 2013.  The requirement to obtain informed consent was waived.  Each CT order for pulmonary angiography was exposed to CDS on the basis of the Wells criteria.   Incremental diagnostic quality gain of CTA over V/Q scan in the assessment of pulmonary embolism by means of a Wells score Bayesian model: results from the ACDC collaboration.  OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate the diagnostic value of computed tomography angiography (CTA) and ventilation perfusion (V/Q) scan in the assessment of pulmonary embolism (PE) by means of a Bayesian statistical model. METHODS: Wells criteria defined pretest probability.    As her immediate risk of VTE was low (Wells criteria), she was advised mechanical measures to prevent VTE along with continuation of rivaroxaban therapy which had already been prescribed for her avalvular atrial fibrillation.    For ED patients aged 18+years with suspected PE, CTPE use and yield were compared 19months pre- and 32months post-implementation of CDS intervention based on the Wells criteria, provided at the time of CTPE order, deployed in April 2012.   Correlation between the Wells score and the Quanadli index in patients with pulmonary embolism.  BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Determining clinical probability of pulmonary embolism (PE) with Wells scoring system is the first step towards diagnosis of PE.  Clinical probability of PE was determined according to the Wells and modified Wells scoring system.  CONCLUSION: Modified Wells criteria have high sensitivity but low specificity in PE diagnostics.   METHODS: This was a prospective investigation of the sensitivity of multidetector CTPA among patients with a priori clinical assessment of a high probability of PE according to the Wells criteria.  When Wells Criteria were dichotomized into pulmonary embolism-unlikely (n=88, 66%) or pulmonary embolism-likely (n=46, 34%), the prevalence was 3% and 28%, respectively.  When Wells Criteria were trichotomized into low pretest probability (n=59, 44%), moderate pretest probability (n=61, 46%), or high pretest probability (n=14, 10%), the pulmonary embolism prevalence was 2%, 15%, and 43%, respectively.  The immunoturbidimetric and rapid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay d -dimer assays had similar sensitivities (94%) and specificities (45% versus 46%). <br><b>CONCLUSION</b>: Wells Criteria have a moderate to substantial interrater agreement and reliably risk stratify pretest probability in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. <br> Prospective validation of Wells Criteria in the evaluation of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism.

"[SOC]###context: Deer are the key hosts of the vector (Ixodes ricinus) that transmits LIV to red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus, causing high mortality.  n Europe the primary arthropod vectors of zoonotic diseases are ticks, which transmit Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (the agent of Lyme disease), tick-borne encephalitis virus and louping ill virus between humans, livestock and wildlife.  Ixodes ricinus ticks and reported tick-borne disease cases are currently increasing in the UK Many vector-borne pathogens whose primary vectors are generalists, such as Ixodid ticks, can infect a wide range of host species and are often zoonotic.  Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and Louping ill virus (LIV) are viruses in the Mammalian tick-borne virus group/genus Flavivirus, causing central nervous system disease.  The complex pathogen-host-vector system of the tick-borne louping-ill virus causes economic losses to sheep and red grouse in upland United Kingdom.  For pathogens transmitted by biting vectors, one of the fundamental assumptions is often that vector bites are the sole or main route of host infection.  Here, we demonstrate experimentally a transmission route whereby hosts (red grouse, Lagopus lagopus scoticus) became infected with a member of the tick-borne encephalitis virus complex, louping ill virus, after eating the infected tick vector.  We used Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) models parameterized for the tick-borne louping ill virus (LIV) system.  This study has examined the efficacy following intramuscular administration of a recombinant Semliki Forest virus (rSFV) vaccine, encoding the prME and NS1 proteins of louping ill virus (LIV), in sheep.

"[SOC]###context: Because of our experience in neuromuscular disorders, we choose six, frequent, autosomal recessive disorders for these clinical and genetic studies: hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type Lom (HMSNL), hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type Russe (HMSNR), congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism syndrome (CCFDN), limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2C (LGMD2C), congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).  The congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome (OMIM 604168) is a recently described autosomal recessive developmental disorder.   Congenital cataracts-facial dysmorphism-neuropathy syndrome (CCFDN, MIM: 604168), is a recently delineated neurogenetic disease causing recurrent episodes of rhabdomyolysis; prevention and early diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis should be part of the clinical management of the disease.  Congenital Cataracts Facial Dysmorphism Neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome is a complex developmental disorder of autosomal recessive inheritance.   OBJECTIVE: To determine the nature and course of ophthalmologic abnormalities in congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome in a genetically verified group of 9 patients.  Congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome (OMIM 604168) is an autosomal recessive developmental disorder that occurs in an endogamous group of Vlax Roma (Gypsies; refs.  1-3).   The major differential diagnosis of MSS is the syndrome defined by congenital cataracts, facial dysmorphism and peripheral neuropathy (CCFDN), which is localised to 18qter.  The CCFDN syndrome is a complex phenotype involving multiple systems, characterized by facial dysmorphism, congenital cataracts, microcorneae, delayed early motor and intellectual development, hypogonadotrop hypogonadism, hypomyelination of the peripheral nervous system, and serious complications related to general anaesthesia.   Developmental abnormalities include congenital cataracts and microcorneae, primary hypomyelination of the peripheral nervous system, impaired physical growth, delayed early motor and intellectual development, mild facial dysmorphism and hypogonadism.  Para-infectious rhabdomyolysis is a serious complication reported in an increasing number of patients.   CONCLUSIONS: Early-onset congenital cataracts associated with microcornea, microphthalmos, and micropupil are essential ocular features of the CCFDN syndrome and are the first recognizable signs during early infancy.   All patients showed a peripheral, demyelinating neuropathy and varying degrees of ataxia.  In the older patients, muscular atrophy in distal muscles and facial dysmorphism was evident.  Early-onset bilateral congenital cataracts associated with microcornea, microphthalmos, and micropupil could be found in all patients.  All children had floppy eyelid syndrome and pseudoptosis.  All patients had syndrome-associated nystagmus and congenital esotropia.  Distant visual acuity could be classified as severe to moderate impairment, whereas near visual acuity was much better (mild to moderate impairment).  Because these families originated from the same genetically isolated founder population as did patients with congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome, and because the two syndromes have clinical manifestations in common, we hypothesized that the two related, albeit distinct, syndromes may represent clinical variants of a single genetic disorder.   Peripheral nerve abnormalities in the congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome.  Congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome: a novel developmental disorder in Gypsies maps to 18qter.  We propose to refer to the syndrome as congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN).   The disorder has been termed the congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome to emphasize its salient features.   Associated neurological features are a moderate nonprogressive cognitive deficit in most affected individuals together with pyramidal signs and mild chorea in some.  Accompanying nonneurological features include short stature, characteristic facial dysmorphism, and hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism.  Nerve conduction studies suggest a hypomyelinating/demyelinating neuropathy, confirmed by nerve biopsy.

Overexpression of Vsr does dramatically increase the stationary-phase reversion of a Lac- frameshift allele, but the absence of Vsr has no effect.  Using rabbit polyclonal antibodies, we have shown that the Dcm cytosine methylase of Escherichia coli is maintained at a constant level during cell growth, while Vsr endonuclease levels are growth phase dependent The efficiency of the two pathways changes during the bacterial life cycle; MMR is more efficient during exponential growth and VSP repair is more efficient during the stationary phase Vsr endonuclease, which initiates very short patch repair, has been hypothesized to regulate mutation in stationary-phase cells

"[SOC]###context: The development of the nervous system involves cells remaining within the neural tube (CNS) and a group of cells that delaminate from the dorsal neural tube and migrate extensively throughout the developing embryo called neural crest cells (NCC).  These cells are a mesenchymal highly migratory group of cells that give rise to a wide variety of cell derivatives: melanocytes, sensory neurons, bone, Schwann cells, etc.   Cell types with neural crest ancestry consequently comprise a number of specialized varieties, such as ectodermal neurons, melanocytes and Schwann cells, as well as mesodermal osteoblasts, adipocytes and smooth muscle cells.   Melanocytes, the pigmented cells of the skin, and the glial Schwann cells lining peripheral nerves are developmentally derived from an early and transient ectodermal structure of the vertebrate embryo, the neural crest, which is also at the origin of multiple neural and non-neural cell types.   Later, SoxE proteins drive the formation of multiple neural crest derivatives including chondrocytes, melanocytes, and cells of the peripheral nervous system, particularly Schwann cells/peripheral glia.   Melanocytes and Schwann cells are derived from the multipotent population of neural crest cells.  The present results suggest that the induced hamster melanomas originate from neural crest-derived cells which are able to differentiate into both melanocytes and Schwann cells.  Melanocytes and Schwann cells both arise from the neural crest during development, and some melanocytes arise directly from Schwann cell precursors lining developing spinal nerves Schwann cells, the myelinating glia of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), originate from multipotent neural crest cells that also give rise to other cells, including neurons, melanocytes, chondrocytes, and smooth muscle cells In the vertebrate embryo, Schwann cells lining the peripheral nerves originate from the neural crest (NC), a structure that also gives rise to ganglion satellite cells, most of the neurons of the peripheral nervous system, melanocytes, and part of the cranial mesenchyme The present results suggest that the induced hamster melanomas originate from neural crest-derived cells which are able to differentiate into both melanocytes and Schwann cells Thus, the nevus cells shared a common nature with epidermal melanocytes and Schwann cells which originate from the neural crest; however, the former cells were somewhat different from the latter two kinds and from benign and malignant tumors derived from these cells in the expression of these antigenic substances Melanocytes, the pigmented cells of the skin, and the glial Schwann cells lining peripheral nerves are developmentally derived from an early and transient ectodermal structure of the vertebrate embryo, the neural crest, which is also at the origin of multiple neural and non-neural cell types Furthermore, although both populations are initially part of the Foxd3 lineage, hypaxial melanocytes lose Foxd3 at late stages upon separation from the nerve, whereas we recently found that epaxial melanocytes segregate earlier from Foxd3-positive neural progenitors while still residing in the dorsal neural tube.   Reversal of developmental restrictions in neural crest lineages: transition from Schwann cells to glial-melanocytic precursors in vitro.  Schwann cells, the myelinating glia of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), originate from multipotent neural crest cells that also give rise to other cells, including neurons, melanocytes, chondrocytes, and smooth muscle cells.  In the vertebrate embryo, Schwann cells lining the peripheral nerves originate from the neural crest (NC), a structure that also gives rise to ganglion satellite cells, most of the neurons of the peripheral nervous system, melanocytes, and part of the cranial mesenchyme.  Thus, the nevus cells shared a common nature with epidermal melanocytes and Schwann cells which originate from the neural crest; however, the former cells were somewhat different from the latter two kinds and from benign and malignant tumors derived from these cells in the expression of these antigenic substances.  Other already committed cells are the angioblasts forming the endothelial lining of the blood vessels, the neural crest cells differentiating into melanocytes and Schwann cells, and the blood-derived cells like chrondro- or osteoclasts.  The dorsal neural tube first generates neural crest cells that exit the neural primordium following an epithelial-to-mesenchymal conversion to become sympathetic ganglia, Schwann cells, dorsal root sensory ganglia, and melanocytes of the skin.  We show here that neural crest cells arising from the neural tube located at the level of somites 47-53 can differentiate both in vitro and in vivo into melanocytes and Schwann cells but not into neurons.  This capacity may be due to the common origin of Schwann cells and melanocytes in the neural crest.  Melanocytes and Schwann cells both arise from the neural crest during development, and some melanocytes arise directly from Schwann cell precursors lining developing spinal nerves.  In the vertebrate embryo, multiple cell types originate from a common structure, the neural crest (NC), which forms at the dorsal tips of the neural epithelium.

Protein tyrosine kinases such as HER-2/c-erbB-2 and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been linked specifically to breast cancer, and perturbations of HER-2 affect response to chemotherapy.  Overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor family member Her-2/neu in breast cancer leads to autophosphorylation of the receptor and induction of multiple downstream signaling pathways, including the Akt kinase to nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) cascade that is associated with poor prognosis.

"[SOC]###context: PBT2 improved cognition in a phase II clinical trial with AD patients, and further clinical testing is currently underway.  In the second trial a successor compound, PBT2, was compared with placebo in 78 participants with mild Alzheimer's dementia; all were included in the intention-to-treat analysis.   The second trial of PBT2 was more rigorously conducted and showed that after 12 weeks this compound appeared to be safe and well tolerated in people with mild Alzheimer's dementia.   The purpose of this mini-review is to highlight the emerging notion that metal chaperones, such as PBT2 (Prana Biotechnology), modulate a variety of critical pathways affecting key aspects of the AD cascade to provide a more ""holistic"" approach to the treatment of this disease.  The Alzheimer's therapeutic PBT2 promotes amyloid-β degradation and GSK3 phosphorylation via a metal chaperone activity.  The leading compound in this class of therapeutic, PBT2, improved cognition in a clinical trial with AD patients.   Intracellular translocation of Zn and Cu via the metal chaperone activity of PBT2 may be an important mechanism by which PBT2 improves cognitive function in people with AD.  Metalloproteinase modifiers such as PBT2 may be useful AD therapies, but current evidence gives no support to their immediate use in pre-symptomatic AD.  The most advanced of these strategies is the so-called 'metal protein attenuating compound' approach, with the lead molecule PBT2 having successfully completed early phase clinical trials.   PBT2 rapidly improves cognition in Alzheimer's Disease: additional phase II analyses.   A recent Phase IIa double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial found that the 250 mg dose of PBT2 was well-tolerated, significantly lowered cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of amyloid-beta42, and significantly improved executive function on a Neuro-psychological Test Battery (NTB) within 12 weeks of treatment in patients with AD.   These findings further encourage larger-scale testing of PBT2 for AD.  Recently, CQ and its analog PBT2 have shown encouraging effects in the animal and clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD).   Experimental treatments potentially useful for Alzheimer's disease include dimebon, PBT2 and etanercept; the safety and efficacy of the Alzheimer's vaccine remains to be proven, and growth hormone secretagogue and tarenflurbil are likely ineffective.   The recent report of positive results from a Phase IIa clinical trial of PBT2, a novel drug that targets amyloid-beta-metal interactions, underscores the value of abnormal transition metal metabolism as a potential therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease.  It has performed very satisfactorily in toxicology and Phase I clinical trials and is advancing as a disease-modifying candidate drug for Alzheimer's disease.  Future trials that are larger and longer will establish if the effects of PBT2 on biomarkers and cognition that are reported here translate into clinical effectiveness.  Small molecules targeting Abeta-metal interactions (e. g. , PBT2) are currently advancing through clinical trials and show increasing promise as disease-modifying agents for Alzheimer's disease based on the ""metal hypothesis.

"[SOC]###context: Here, we evaluate the therapeutic potential of the TH analog 3,5,3',5'-tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac) as a replacement for T(4) in brain development.   This treatment was sufficient to promote TH-dependent neuronal differentiation in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and striatum but was ineffective in suppressing hypothalamic TRH expression.   In the current study, we investigated the effect of a natural thyroid hormone analogue - 3, 3?, 5-triiodo-thyroacetic acid (TRIAC) on regulating proliferation and differentiation and its possible molecular mechanism in normal human epidermal keratinocytes and C57BL/6 mice.

"[SOC]###context: Recent advances in our understanding of the three-dimensional organization of the eukaryotic nucleus have rendered the spatial distribution of genes increasingly relevant.  In a recent work (Tsochatzidou et al. , Nucleic Acids Res 45:5818-5828, 2017), we proposed the existence of a functional compartmentalization of the yeast genome according to which, genes occupying the chromosomal regions at the nuclear periphery have distinct structural, functional and evolutionary characteristics compared to their centromeric-proximal counterparts.  Around the same time, it was also shown that the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is organized in topologically associated domains (TADs), which are largely associated with the replication timing.  Form and function of topologically associating genomic domains in budding yeast.  Although similar structures appear to be conserved in fission yeast, computational modeling and analysis of high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data have been used to argue that the small, highly constrained budding yeast chromosomes could not have these structures.  In contrast, herein we analyze Hi-C data for budding yeast and identify 200-kb scale TADs, whose boundaries are enriched for transcriptional activity.  Furthermore, these boundaries separate regions of similarly timed replication origins connecting the long-known effect of genomic context on replication timing to genome architecture.  To investigate the molecular basis of TAD formation, we performed Hi-C experiments on cells depleted for the Forkhead transcription factors, Fkh1 and Fkh2, previously associated with replication timing.  Forkhead factors do not regulate TAD formation, but do promote longer-range genomic interactions and control interactions between origins near the centromere.  Thus, our work defines spatial organization within the budding yeast nucleus, demonstrates the conserved role of genome architecture in regulating DNA replication, and identifies a molecular mechanism specifically regulating interactions between pericentric origins.  Around the same time, it was also shown that the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is organized in topologically associated domains (TADs), which are largely associated with the replication timing.

The effects of both ATX-II and the N(1325)S mutation were reversed by either I(NaL) inhibition (with ranolazine or tetrodotoxin) or CaMKII inhibition (with KN93 or autocamtide 2-related inhibitory peptide).  Such changes were related to enhanced Ca(2+)/calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) activity and increased phosphorylation of its targets.  Ranolazine at therapeutic concentrations partially reversed the HCM-related cellular abnormalities via I(NaL) inhibition, with negligible effects in controls.  By shortening the action potential duration in HCM cardiomyocytes, ranolazine reduced the occurrence of early and delayed afterdepolarizations.  Finally, as a result of the faster kinetics of Ca(2+)(i) transients and the lower diastolic Ca(2+)(i), ranolazine accelerated the contraction-relaxation cycle of HCM trabeculae, ameliorating diastolic function.

Its activity is normally not detectable in most somatic cells while it is reactivated in the vast majority of cancer cells.  Therefore, inhibition of telomerase has been viewed as a promising anticancer approach due to its specificity for cancer cells.  Telomerase activity is found in 85%-90% of all human cancers but not in their adjacent normal cells.  Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is an essential component in the telomerase complex that plays an important role in telomerase activity.  elomerase activation is considered to be a critical step in carcinogenesis and its activity correlates closely with human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression.

"[SOC]###context: Microsporidia are a diverse group of obligate, intracellular, eukaryotic, spore-forming parasites.  Traditionally, these were considered as protozoans but recently have been reclassified as fungi.   Microsporidia are ubiquitous fungi with genomes that have undergone a strong reduction Microsporidia are unicellular fungi that are obligate endoparasites.   Phylogenomics supports microsporidia as the earliest diverging clade of sequenced fungi.  A combined analysis of thousands of gene trees supports a topology in which microsporidia is a sister group to all other sequenced fungi.  Altogether, our data strongly support a scenario in which microsporidia is the earliest-diverging clade of sequenced fungi.  Microsporidia are a large diverse group of intracellular parasites now considered as fungi.  The unique genomic hallmarks between microsporidia and fungi are independent of sequence based phylogenetic comparisons and further contribute to define the borders of the fungal kingdom and support the classification of microsporidia as unusual derived fungi.  The kingdom Fungi is expanded by adding Microsporidia, because of protein sequence evidence that these amitochondrial intracellular parasites are related to conventional Fungi, not Protozoa.  The preponderance of evidence as to the origin of the microsporidia reveals a close relationship with the fungi, either within the kingdom or as a sister group to it.  In a subsequent analysis, we excluded the other Microsporidia from the analysis to look for relationships before the divergence of Microsporidia, and found that 43% of the microsporidial genes scored highest with fungal genes, and a higher mean LPI was found with Fungi than with other kingdoms, suggesting that Microsporidia is closely related to Fungi at the genomic level.

We used a lentiviral vector encoding functional WASP to genetically correct HSPCs from three WAS patients and reinfused the cells after a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen We used a lentiviral vector to transfer a functional ARSA gene into hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from three presymptomatic patients who showed genetic, biochemical, and neurophysiological evidence of late infantile MLD.   We assessed lentiviral vectors (LVs) targeted to the EC surface marker CD105 for in vivo gene delivery.  gef and apoptin genes were cloned into a doxycycline-regulated retrovirus-mediated gene expression system. 
###question: Are retroviruses used for gene therapy?[EOC] [SOR]###response: Gene therapy is one of the most promising and active fields in therapeutic research.  Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect.  Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny.  High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer.  Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies.  Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production.  Several monogenic inherited diseases, mostly immunodeficiencies, can now be successfully treated. [EOR]"
"[SOC]###context: Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have allowed the characterization of more than 40 new susceptibility genes and the confirmation of a marked differential genetic background between patients expressing anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA, approximately 80% of all RA patients) and ACPA negative RA patients Firstly, we review here the major advances in identifying RA genetic susceptibility markers both within and outside of the MHC.   The most relevant non-HLA gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with RA include PTPN22, IL23R, TRAF1, CTLA4, IRF5, STAT4, CCR6, PADI4.  Large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 30 loci involved in RA pathogenesis.  The meta-analysis results showed that: (1) 30, 28 and 26 SNPs were significantly associated with RA (P<0. 01) for the allele, dominant, and recessive models, respectively.  This paper compares corresponding non-MHC genomic regions identified in rodent and human genome-wide association studies (GWAS).  To date, over 30 non-MHC RA-associated loci have been identified in humans, and over 100 arthritis-associated loci have been identified in rodent models of RA Interestingly, a series of candidate genes have been identified outside of the classical major histocompatibility (MHC) locus, which had long been regarded as the major contributor to the pathogenesis of this disease Among these genes, PTPN22 plays an outstanding role.  CD40, STAT4, PRM1, and TNFAIP3 also seem to be of relevance Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) added about 10 new loci to the list of already more than 20 loci associated with RA, so the list is now over 30 Previous studies demonstrate that 6 of the established non-HLA CD and RA risk loci (out of 26 loci for each disease) are shared between both diseases.  These new associations bring the total number of confirmed rheumatoid arthritis risk loci to 31 among individuals of European ancestry An additional 11 SNPs replicated at P < 0. 05, many of which are validated autoimmune risk alleles, suggesting that most represent genuine rheumatoid arthritis risk alleles.  Genome-wide association studies have expanded the number of validated RA risk loci beyond HLA-DRB1 ""shared epitope"" alleles to include additional major histocompatibility complex (MHC) risk alleles and more than 10 regions outside the MHC.  We successfully identified 41 significant SNPs relevant to RA, 25 associated genes and a number of important SNP-SNP interactions (SNP patterns) A total of 47 candidate regions were identified.

"[SOC]###context: Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) shows constitutive activity in CLL and is the target of irreversible inhibition by ibrutinib, an orally bioavailable kinase inhibitor that has shown outstanding activity in CLL.  Early clinical results in CLL with other reversible and irreversible BTK inhibitors have been less promising, however, raising the question of whether BTK kinase activity is an important target of ibrutinib and also in CLL.   Inhibition of BTK kinase activity through either targeted genetic inactivation or ibrutinib in the TCL1 mouse significantly delays the development of CLL, demonstrating that BTK is a critical kinase for CLL development and expansion and thus an important target of ibrutinib.   Ibrutinib, an inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase is showing impressive responses in heavily pre-treated high-risk CLL, whether alone or in combination with MoAbs or chemotherapy.  Ibrutinib acts by inhibiting the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) while idelalisib represents a first-in-class specific inhibitor of the phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) delta isoform.   Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib or the PI3K inhibitor idelalisib block B-cell receptor induced activation of LCP1.   Targeting BTK with ibrutinib in relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

Recent clinical data suggest remarkable activity of ibrutinib, the first-in-class covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), as well as excellent activity in other B cell malignancies, including in particular mantle cell lymphoma and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia.

Ibrutinib, a Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has shown highly encouraging results in phase I/II trials in patients with treatment-naive, relapsed and refractory CLL even in the presence of high risk disease or poor prognostic markers.   The compounds that are currently investigated in patients with CLL include ibrutinib -inhibitor of Btk, fostamatinib-inhibitor of Syk and idelalisib (GS-1101) -a specific isoform of the PI3K (PI3K) inhibitor.   Ibrutinib (PCI-32765), demonstrated that Btk inhibition sensitizes CLL cells to apoptosis and alters their migratory behavior, these studies however did not address whether Btk-mediated signaling is involved in the process of CLL leukemogenesis.   Small molecule inhibitors of BCR signaling kinases, Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitor ibrutinib and the phosphoinositide 3'-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) inhibitor GS-1101, are currently transforming the landscape of CLL therapy.   More recently, several KIs have been developed to target the proximal B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway including spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Fostamatinib) and Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Ibrutinib, AVL-263).

"[SOC]###context: The genetic basis of this disease has been attributed to mutations in one of two unlinked genes, TSC1 and TSC2.  The functions of the TSC1 and TSC2 gene products, hamartin and tuberin, respectively, have remained ill defined until recently Genetic, biochemical, and biologic analyses have highlighted their role as negative regulators of the mTOR signaling pathway.  Tuberin, serving as a substrate of AKT and AMPK, mediates mTOR activity by coordinating inputs from growth factors and energy availability in the control of cell growth, proliferation, and survival.  Emerging evidence also suggests that the TSC 1/2 complex may play a role in modulating the activity of beta-catenin and TGFbeta.  These findings provide novel functional links between the TSC genes and other tumor suppressors Ten years ago, a mutation in the TSC2 gene was identified in the Eker rat at Fox Chase Cancer Center by Yeung and Knudson, and in Tokyo by Kobayashi and Hino.  Here, we will review the clinical association of RCC in TSC, consider the factors that have led to its under-emphasis within the RCC field, address the cellular and biochemical mechanisms that may contribute to RCC in cells with TSC1 or TSC2 mutations, and finally discuss the ways in which the TSC signaling pathways may be linked to sporadic RCC in the general population.  Either of two genes, TSC1 or TSC2, can be mutated, resulting in the tuberous sclerosis complex phenotype.  The protein products of the tuberous sclerosis complex genes, hamartin (TSC1) and tuberin (TSC2), have been discovered to play important roles in several cell-signaling pathways Knowledge regarding the function of the tuberin-hamartin complex has led to therapeutic intervention trials.   TSC2 mutations were identified in all cyst-positive patients who were tested (n = 8), whereas both TSC1 and TSC2 mutations were found in patients with nodular disease.  We previously found TSC2 loss of heterozygosity in 7 of 13 (54%) of angiomyolipomas from sporadic LAM patients, suggesting that LAM and TSC could have a common genetic basis.  Mutations in the tuberous sclerosis complex gene TSC2 are a cause of sporadic pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis The disease can be caused by mutations in either of two genes, TSC2, identified in 1993, and TSC1, only recently identified.

Indeed, the RET ligands persephin and GDNF robustly stimulated calcitonin mRNA, which was blocked by pretreatment with NVP-AST487 The ligands bind RET through GDNF family receptor alpha, termed GFRalpha1-4 RET is activated by members of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family of ligands, which include GDNF, neurturin, artemin, and persephin GDNF availability determines enteric neuron number by controlling precursor proliferation Five germline mutations in the glial cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) gene, one of the RET ligands, have been detected in HSCR patients.  The glial-cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family receptors alpha (GFRalpha) are cell surface bound glycoproteins that mediate interactions of the GDNF ligand family with the RET receptor In particular, the recent identification of neurotrophic factors acting as RET ligands (GDNF and Neurturin) provide additional candidate genes for HSCR.   Mutations in genes that encode RET ligands (GDNF and NTN); components of another signaling pathway (EDNRB, EDN3, ECE-1); and the transcription factor, SOX10, have been identified in HSCR patients.  Expression of RET and its ligand complexes, GDNF/GFRalpha-1 and NTN/GFRalpha-2, in medullary thyroid carcinomas Mutations in the GDNF gene, and encoding one of the RET ligands, either alone or in combination with RET mutations, can also cause HSCR, as can mutations in four other genes (EDN3, EDNRB, ECE1, and SOX10) In particular, the recent identification of neurotrophic factors acting as RET ligands (GDNF and Neurturin) provide additional candidate genes for HSCR.   Ret ligands have been recently identified as the neuron survival factor GDNF (Glial-Derived Neurotrophic Factor) and Neurturin.  Mutation of the RET ligand, neurturin, supports multigenic inheritance in Hirschsprung disease Considering that RET and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) mutations have been reported in the disease, we regarded the other RET ligand, neurturin (NTN), as an attractive candidate gene, especially as it shares large homologies with GDNF Given the pivotal role of RET in HSCR, the genes encoding their ligands (GDNF, NRTN, ARTN, and PSPN) are also good candidates for the disease The c-ret protooncogene, RET, encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase.  RET is activated by members of the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family of ligands, which include GDNF, neurturin, artemin, and persephin Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), a ligand of RET tyrosine kinase, and its family ligands promote the survival and differentiation of a variety of neurons.  We demonstrate here that, after injury, the absence of c-Jun specifically in SCs caused impaired axonal regeneration and severely increased neuronal cell death.  c-Jun deficiency resulted in decreased expression of several neurotrophic factors, and GDNF and Artemin, both of which encode ligands for the Ret receptor tyrosine kinase, were identified as novel direct c-Jun target genes.  GDNF, now known to be the first identified member of a family of factors, signals through the previously known receptor tyrosine kinase, Ret.  Unlike most ligands for receptor tyrosine kinases, GDNF does not bind and activate Ret directly, but requires the presence of GPI-linked coreceptors.  BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: In 1996, the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) was identified as one of the ligands of the RET transmembrane receptor.  The ret proto-oncogene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase whose ligands belong to the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) protein family.

We conclude that CADASIL mutants of NOTCH3 complex with NOTCH1, 3, and 4, slow NOTCH3 clearance, and that overexpressed wild type and mutant NOTCH3 protein interfere with key NOTCH-mediated functions in smooth muscle cells.  In the vertebrate embryo, skeletal muscle is derived from the myotome of the somites.  Notch1-3 demonstrate overlapping and distinct expression patterns in mouse somites.

"[SOC]###context: This article contains a protocol for selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension and sequencing (SHAPE-Seq) that, through a combination of structure-dependent chemical probing and next-generation sequencing technologies, achieves structural characterization of hundreds of RNAs in a single experiment.  This protocol is applicable in a variety of conditions, and represents an important tool for understanding RNA biology.  The protocol includes methods for the design and synthesis of RNA mixtures for study, and the construction and analysis of structure-dependent sequencing libraries that reveal structural information of the RNAs in the mixtures.  The methods are generally applicable to studying RNA structure and interactions in vitro in a variety of conditions, and allows for the rapid characterization of RNA structures in a high-throughput manner.  We focus on a novel assay utilizing this approach, called selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension sequencing (SHAPE-Seq), that can be used to characterize RNA secondary and tertiary structure.  We describe a fully automated data analysis pipeline for SHAPE-Seq analysis that includes read processing, mapping, and structural inference based on a model of the experiment.  Our methods rely on the solution of a series of convex optimization problems for which we develop efficient and effective numerical algorithms.  We have developed a high-throughput technique, SHAPE-Seq, that can simultaneously measure quantitative, single nucleotide-resolution secondary and tertiary structural information for hundreds of RNA molecules of arbitrary sequence.  SHAPE-Seq combines selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) chemistry with multiplexed paired-end deep sequencing of primer extension products.  This generates millions of sequencing reads, which are then analyzed using a fully automated data analysis pipeline, based on a rigorous maximum likelihood model of the SHAPE-Seq experiment.

"[SOC]###context: CONCLUSION: Patients assigned a higher serum magnesium concentration had a reduced incidence of vasospasm as seen by angiography, but the difference was not statistically significant.  Clinically significant outcomes were not different between groups.  158 patients (26·2%) had poor outcome in the magnesium group compared with 151 (25·3%) in the placebo group (risk ratio [RR] 1·03, 95% CI 0·85-1·25).  Our updated meta-analysis of seven randomised trials involving 2047 patients shows that magnesium is not superior to placebo for reduction of poor outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (RR 0·96, 95% CI 0·86-1·08).  INTERPRETATION: Intravenous magnesium sulphate does not improve clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, therefore routine administration of magnesium cannot be recommended.   There is a tendency in the magnesium group to have better outcomes.   Due to inconsistently reported benefits and the occurrence of side effects, phase II data suggested that intravenous magnesium for SAH provided either no overall net benefit or uncertain trade-offs.  Benefit was likewise not supported in the single phase III clinical trial.  tatistically significant clinical benefits could not be demonstrated for the other drugs (clazosentan, statins, and magnesium).  CONCLUSIONS: Insufficient evidence is available to support the use of the triple-H therapy, clazosentan, statins, or magnesium sulfate for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage.   Magnesium sulfate decreased the rate of cerebral infarction, but not of DCI or poor functional outcome.  Regarding outcome, a beneficial effect of magnesium sulfate on outcome can not be ruled out because of sample size limitations.  CONCLUSIONS: The present findings do not lend support to a beneficial effect of magnesium sulphate infusion on delayed cerebral infarction.  The reduction in DCI and improvement in the clinical outcomes of aneurysmal SAH patients following magnesium sulphate infusion observed in previous pilot studies are not confirmed, although a beneficial effect cannot be ruled out because of sample size limitation.  Favorable outcome (Good recovery and moderate disability, as defined by Glasgow Outcome Scale) was achieved in 20 of 30 (67%) patients receiving magnesium sulfate infusion and 16 of 30 (53%) patients receiving placebo treatment, p = 0. 292, odds ratio 1. 750, 95% CI 0. 616-4. 974.  Similarly, the pooled odds ratio for favorable outcome is 1. 598, 95% CI 1. 074-2. 377, statistically significant.   RESULTS: The worst clinical outcomes at 6 months were seen in MgSO(4) group patients, with mean plasma magnesium concentrations in the fourth quartile, and in placebo group patients, with mean such concentrations in the third and fourth quartiles.  CONCLUSIONS: No evidence was found to suggest that a higher mean plasma magnesium concentration improves clinical outcomes.  On the contrary, we found an association between high plasma magnesium concentration and worse clinical outcomes.  The proportions of patients with a favorable outcome at 6 months (Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale 5 to 8) were similar, 64% in the magnesium sulfate group and 63% in the saline group (OR, 1. 0; 95% CI, 0. 7 to 1. 6).  Secondary outcome analyses (modified Rankin Scale, Barthel Index, Short Form 36, and clinical vasospasm) also showed no significant differences between the 2 groups.   CONCLUSIONS: The results do not support a clinical benefit of intravenous magnesium sulfate infusion over placebo infusion in patients with acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Magnesium infusion reduced the risk of poor outcome and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI): the relative risk was 0. 62 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0. 46-0. 83) and 0. 73 (95% CI 0. 53-1. 00), respectively.   CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis suggests that intravenous magnesium therapy reduces the risk of DCI and poor outcome after aneurysmal SAH.   The incidence of delayed ischemic infarction was significantly lower in magnesium-treated patients (22% vs.  51%; p = . 002); 34 of 54 magnesium patients and 27 of 53 control patients reached good outcome (p = . 209).  BACKGROUND: A meta-analysis of current data suggests that magnesium sulfate infusion improves the outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage through a reduction in delayed ischemic neurological deficit.   These data imply that intravenous magnesium therapy, besides a supposed beneficial effect on outcome, also provides pain relief for SAH patients, for whom it might also improve functional outcome.  Preliminary evidence has suggested that magnesium sulfate infusion reduces delayed ischemic neurological deficit and improves clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.   In a phase II randomized clinical trial of 283 patients, magnesium treatment reduced the risk of DCI by 34% and of poor outcome by 23%.  BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that high-dose MgSO4 therapy is safe and reduces the incidence of DIND and subsequent poor outcome after SAH.   On-treatment analysis showed a significantly better outcome after 3 months (P = . 017) and a trend toward better outcome after 1 year (P = . 083).    CONCLUSIONS: High-dose MgSO4 therapy might be efficient as a prophylactic adjacent therapy after SAH to reduce the risk for poor outcome.   There was no significant difference in mortality rate at discharge (p = 0. 328).  A trend toward improved outcome as measured by the modifed Rankin Scale (p = 0. 084), but not the Glasgow Outcome Scale (p = 1. 0), was seen in the MgSO4 treated group.  CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the results suggests that MgSO4 infusion may have a role in cerebral vasospasm prophylaxis if therapy is initiated within 48 hours of aneurysm rupture.  There was, however, no difference between groups in functional recovery or Glasgow Outcome Scale score.   Patients receiving MgSO4 tended to have fewer neurological deficits, better functional recovery and an improved score in GOS.   CONCLUSIONS: MgSO4 infusion after aneurysmal SAH is well tolerated and may be useful in producing better outcome.  CONCLUSION: Magnesium did not seem to interfere in vasospasm frequency but apparently acted favorably in decreasing morbidity and length of hospital stay.  None of the patients died; no CT evidence of ischemic infarction was present; and most had good outcomes (GOS 5 in 10 patients; GOS 4 in 8 patients).  At that time, 18 patients in the treatment group and 6 in the placebo group had an excellent outcome (risk ratio, 3. 4; 95% CI, 1. 3 to 8. 9).  CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that magnesium reduces DCI and subsequent poor outcome, but the results are not yet definitive.   We observed a trend in which a higher percentage of patients obtained GOS scores of 4 or 5 in the group treated with MgSO4, but the trend did not reach a statistically significant level.   Magnesium sulfate treatment improves outcome in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage: a meta-analysis study.  BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pilot clinical trials using magnesium sulfate in patients with acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage have reported trends toward improvement in clinical outcomes.  Preliminary evidence has suggested that magnesium sulfate infusion reduces delayed ischemic neurological deficit and improves clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Our results indicate that although there was reduced likelihood of a poor outcome for patients treated with magnesium sulfate after SAH, patient mortality was not improved.  CONCLUSION: Administration of intra-arterial magnesium sulfate in combination with nicardipine was well tolerated in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral vasospasm without a significant change in MAP and ICP.  Current evidence does not support the prophylactic use of magnesium sulfate in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage Preliminary evidence has suggested that magnesium sulfate infusion reduces delayed ischemic neurological deficit and improves clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage A meta-analysis of current data suggests that magnesium sulfate infusion improves the outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage through a reduction in delayed ischemic neurological deficit Despite the publication of several randomized controlled studies, there is still much debate on whether magnesium sulfate improves outcome in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage Magnesium sulphate is a neuroprotective agent that might improve outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage by reducing the occurrence or improving the outcome of delayed cerebral ischaemia
###question: Does magnesium sulfate improve outcomes of subarachnoid hemorrhage patients?[EOC] [SOR]###response: No.  Although initial studies have provided with encouraging findings regarding administration of magnesium sulphate in aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage patients, but subsequent larger studies have reported that intravenous magnesium sulphate does not improve clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, therefore routine administration of magnesium cannot be recommended.

"[SOC]###context: The Center of Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CESD) (sensitivity: 0. 75; 95% CI 0. 60 to 0. 85; specificity: 0. 88; 95% CI 0. 71 to 0. 95), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) (sensitivity: 0. 84; 95% CI 0. 75 to 0. 90; specificity:0. 83; 95% CI 0. 72 to 0. 90) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 (sensitivity: 0. 86; 95% CI 0. 70 to 0. 94; specificity: 0. 79; 95% CI 0. 60 to 0. 90) appeared to be the optimal measures for screening measures.  There are a number of possible instruments that may help in screening for poststroke depression but none are satisfactory for case-finding.  Preliminary data suggests the CESD, HDRS or the PHQ-9 as the most promising options.  The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-depression subscale (HADS-D), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD), and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) were administered.  The balance of sensitivity and specificity was assessed using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis.  RESULTS: Discriminating abilities of all the scales for major and all PSD were good (area under ROC values 0. 88-0. 93 and 0. 88-0. 92 at 2 weeks; and 0. 93-0. 96 and 0. 89-0. 91 at 1 year, respectively).  We compared the Beck Depression Inventory, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Visual Analogue Mood Scale, proxy assessment, and Clinical Global Impression of the nursing and study personnel, together with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd Edition, Revised diagnosis, in assessing depression after stroke in a follow-up study of 100 patients.  The sensitivity and specificity against the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria were acceptable with the Clinical Global Impression, Beck Depression Inventory, and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, mostly in the range of 0. 70 to 1. 00.  The Visual Analogue Mood Scale was not a sensitive instrument (sensitivity, 0. 20 to 0. 60) and did not correlate with the Beck Depression Inventory during the first year after stroke.  Beck Depression Inventory, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and Clinical Global Impression assessment by professionals, in addition to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd Edition, Revised diagnosis, are useful in assessing depression, but none of these instruments clearly stood apart from the others.  Proxy ratings should be used with caution, and the use of the Visual Analogue Mood Scale among patients with aphasia and other cognitive impairments cannot be recommended.  This study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the Poststroke Depression Rating Scale (PSDRS), a diagnostic tool specifically devised to assess depression after stroke, in comparison to the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham-D).  At their optimum cut-off points, the Ham-D and PSDRS showed good sensitivity and specificity for MDL or MDL + MDDM; the PSDRS had a higher positive predictive value for MDL in respect of the Ham-D (78 vs.  59%).  Furthermore, the diagnostic accuracy of the PSDRS was higher in respect of the Ham-D in aphasic patients.  The Ham-D and PSDRS are both reliable diagnostic tools for the diagnosis of PSD.  We suggest that the PSDRS could be a useful tool in clinical practice and in therapeutic trials.  The psychiatrist classified 25/71 (35. 2%) patients as depressed.  Using the recommended cut-point of 2 or more on the Signs of Depression Scale, the nurse and carer respectively rated 27/71 (38. 0%) and 18/30 (60. 0%) patients as potentially depressed.  The proportion of patients correctly identified as depressed by the test (sensitivity) when rated by nurses was 64%, and the proportion of patients not depressed who were correctly identified by the test (specificity) was 61%, whereas carers achieved sensitivity 90% and specificity 35%.  The Signs of Depression Scale is easily completed by clinical staff, although we found the sensitivity when completed by nurses to be low.  Information from carers shows potential to improve screening and it is important for nurses to value the knowledge and skills of carers in detecting depression following a stroke.  Further refinement of the Signs of Depression Scale, with accompanying research, is required.  The VAMS was not useful in screening for depression in Chinese stroke patients while both the HADS and the GDS demonstrated satisfactory accuracy in detecting depression in Chinese stroke patients.  At their respective optimum cutoff values, the sensitivity of the self-rated scales varied between 80% and 90%, while the specificity was about 60%.  For the observer-rated scale (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale), sensitivity was 78. 1%, and specificity was 74. 6%.  The hypothesis was supported: in contrast to psychiatric interview (68% depressed) and self-report (Beck Depression Inventory, 50% depressed), none of the patients were described as depressed in chart notes by the rehabilitation team (excluding the psychiatrists).  Although there were no marked differences in the screening abilities for PSD between the scales, differences were found in factors influencing misclassification.  Assessment scales with less somatic items may be recommended for the screening of PSD, particularly at the acute phase of stroke. 
###question: Which depression rating scales were shown to have acceptable psychometric properties for screening of poststroke depression?[EOC] [SOR]###response: The Center of Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and the Patient Health Questionnaire, The Beck Depression Inventory, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-depression subscale, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, Poststroke Depression Rating Scale and Clinical Global Impression scale appeared to have acceptable psychometric properties for identifying depression in patients after stroke.  Therefore, these scales can be used for screening of post-stroke depression.  Signs of Depression Scale and Visual Analogue Mood Scale showed inferior psychometric properties and therefore should not be used for screening for post-stroke depression. [EOR]"

Our finding that CD28 is a direct receptor of superantigen toxins broadens the scope of microbial pathogen recognition mechanisms.  CD28: direct and critical receptor for superantigen toxins.  The need to protect from superantigen toxins led to our discovery that in addition to the well-known MHC class II and T cell receptors, the principal costimulatory receptor, CD28, and its constitutively expressed coligand, B7-2 (CD86), previously thought to have only costimulatory function, are actually critical superantigen receptors.   Structural analysis showed that when a superantigen binds to the T cell receptor on the T cell and major histocompatibility class II molecule on the antigen-presenting cell, CD28 can be accommodated readily as third superantigen receptor in the quaternary complex, with the CD28 dimer interface oriented towards the β-strand/hinge/α-helix domain in the superantigen.   Our finding that CD28 is a direct receptor of superantigen toxins broadens the scope of microbial pathogen recognition mechanisms.   The novel role of CD28 as receptor for a class of microbial pathogens, the superantigen toxins, broadens the scope of pathogen recognition mechanisms.

CD28 is a homodimer expressed on T cells that functions as the principal costimulatory ligand in the immune response through an interaction with its B7 coligands, yet we show here that to elicit inflammatory cytokine gene expression and toxicity, superantigens must bind directly into the dimer interface of CD28.

PRESENTATION OF CASE: Here we describe the second ever published case of C.  canimorsus bacteremia presenting with acute cholecystitis.  The patient presented with epigastric pain and sepsis three weeks post domestic dog bite.   CONCLUSION: We strongly advocate blood cultures in patients who present with abdominal pain and sepsis, particularly when they have a recent history of animal bite.  In cases of cholecystitis secondary to C.  canimorsus it may be necessary to monitor the patient's progress more closely and treat with prolonged targeted antibiotic therapy.

GATA3 is responsible for induction of T(h)2 differentiation and represses T(h)1 differentiation.  Genome-wide analysis reveals unique regulation of transcription of Th2-specific genes by GATA3  IL-4-mediated STAT6 activation induces high levels of transcription of GATA3, a master regulator of Th2 cell differentiation, and enforced expression of GATA3 induces Th2 cytokine expression.  T-bet and GATA3 orchestrate Th1 and Th2 differentiation through lineage-specific targeting of distal regulatory elements.  T-bet and GATA3 regulate the CD4+ T cell Th1/Th2 cell fate decision but little is known about the interplay between these factors outside of the murine Ifng and Il4/Il5/Il13 loci We propose these aspects of T-bet and GATA3 function are important for Th1/Th2 differentiation and for understanding transcription factor interactions in other T cell lineage decisions.  T helper 2 cells regulate inflammatory responses to helminth infections while also mediating pathological processes of asthma and allergy.  IL-4 promotes Th2 development by inducing the expression of the GATA3 transcription factor, and the Th2 phenotype is stabilized by a GATA3-dependent autoregulatory loop.  Type I IFN reverses human Th2 commitment and stability by suppressing GATA3.  Our results suggest that the balance of Runx3 and GATA3 is one factor that influences the manifestation of CD4(+) cells as the Th1 or Th2 phenotypes.  Moreover, the expression of the Th2 transcription factor, GATA3, was significantly reduced in PKCtheta-deficient T cells.  Impaired GATA3-dependent chromatin remodeling and Th2 cell differentiation leading to attenuated allergic airway inflammation in aging mice In addition, reduced expression of GATA3 was detected in developing Th2 cells.   transduction of Runx1 into wild-type T cells caused a complete attenuation of Th2 differentiation and was accompanied by the cessation of GATA3 expression A critical role for NF-kappa B in GATA3 expression and TH2 differentiation in allergic airway inflammation.

We also assessed these functions in mice treated with a known heat shock protein inducer, arimoclomol.   Under conditions of excessive stress, arimoclomol induces amplification of the cytoprotective heat shock response in order to protect motor neurons from death.   Although both arimoclomol and celastrol induced the expression of Hsp70 Arimoclomol, an amplifier of heat shock protein expression involved in cellular stress response, has emerged as a potential therapeutic candidate in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in recent years.

Lossless compression methods are now close to their theoretical limits and hence there is a need for lossy methods that further reduce the complexity of these data without impacting downstream analyses.

Aortitis includes conditions with infectious or non-infectious etiology, characterized by inflammatory changes in one or more layers in aortic wall.  Aortitis and periaortitis are inflammatory diseases of the aorta and its main branches; they differ in the extension of inflammation, which is confined to the aortic wall in aortitis Aortitis is classified as non-infectious or infectious.   ""Aortitis"" is a pathologic term that refers to an abnormal inflammation of the aortic wall.  IgG4 related thoracic aortitis is a recent addition to the differential diagnosis for inflammatory aortic disease - a condition which is often underappreciated until complications arise such as aneurysmal formation or aortic dissection.  C BACKGROUND Inflammation of the aortic wall, known as aortitis, is a rare clinical entity which is frequently asymptomatic, or identified when the patient presents with an aortic aneurysm or dissection.  It i Syphilitic aortitis is a productive inflammatory process, the earliest and most constant feature of which is a perivascular round cell infiltration in the adventitia.  Non-infectious aortitis represents a common feature of large-vessel vasculitides but can also be isolated or associated with other rheumatologic conditions.  Aortitis is a subtype of the more general term ""vasculitis"", an inflammatory condition of infectious or noninfectious origin involving the vessel wall.  Aortitis and periaortitis are inflammatory diseases of the aorta and its main branches; they differ in the extension of inflammation, which is confined to the aortic wall in aortitis, and spreads to the periaortic space in periaortitis.  Takayasu aortitis is a well known yet rare form of large vessel vasculitis.  Aortitis is a general term denoting inflammation of the aortic wall.  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Aortitis is the inflammation of the aorta due Aortitis is the all-encompassing pathological term ascribed to inflammation of the aorta.

"[SOC]###context: Elementary flux modes (EFMs) analysis constitutes a fundamental tool in systems biology.  However, the efficient calculation of EFMs in genome-scale metabolic networks (GSMNs) is still a challenge.  We present a novel algorithm that uses a linear programming-based tree search and efficiently enumerates a subset of EFMs in GSMNs. RESULTS: Our approach is compared with the EFMEvolver approach, demonstrating a significant improvement in computation time.  We also validate the usefulness of our new approach by studying the acetate overflow metabolism in the Escherichia coli bacteria.  To do so, we computed 1 million EFMs for each energetic amino acid and then analysed the relevance of each energetic amino acid based on gene/protein expression data and the obtained EFMs.  We found good agreement between previous experiments and the conclusions reached using EFMs.  Finally, we also analysed the performance of our approach when applied to large GSMNs.

Elementary flux modes (EFMs) are a key tool for analyzing genome-scale metabolic networks, and several methods have been proposed to compute them.  Among them, those based on solving linear programming (LP) problems are known to be very efficient if the main interest lies in computing large enough sets of EFMs. RESULTS: Here, we propose a new method called EFM-Ta that boosts the efficiency rate by analyzing the information provided by the LP solver.  We base our method on a further study of the final tableau of the simplex method.  By performing additional elementary steps and avoiding trivial solutions consisting of two cycles, we obtain many more EFMs for each LP problem posed, improving the efficiency rate of previously proposed methods by more than one order of magnitude.

Although there has been considerable debate about whether paternal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) transmission may coexist with maternal transmission of mtDNA, it is generally believed that mitochondria and mtDNA are exclusively maternally inherited in humans.  Here, we identified three unrelated multigeneration families with a high level of mtDNA heteroplasmy (ranging from 24 to 76%) in a total of 17 individuals.  Heteroplasmy of mtDNA was independently examined by high-depth whole mtDNA sequencing analysis in our research laboratory and in two Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments and College of American Pathologists-accredited laboratories using multiple approaches.  A comprehensive exploration of mtDNA segregation in these families shows biparental mtDNA transmission with an autosomal dominantlike inheritance mode.  Our results suggest that, although the central dogma of maternal inheritance of mtDNA remains valid, there are some exceptional cases where paternal mtDNA could be passed to the offspring.

"[SOC]###context: Mediator plays a significant role in higher-order genome organization.  Mediator, in addition to binding Pol II promoters, occupies chromosomal interacting domain (CID) boundaries and that Mediator in chromatin associates with proteins that have been shown to interact with CID boundaries, such as Sth1, Ssu72 and histone H4 Together with architectural proteins and transcriptional regulators, such as CTCF and Mediator, respectively, it contributes to genome organization at different scales and thereby affects transcription, DNA replication, and locus rearrangement.  By defining the organizational hierarchy of the genome, determining changes in chromatin organization associated with changes in cell identity, and describing chromatin organization within the context of linear genomic features (such as chromatin modifications and transcription factor binding) and architectural proteins (including Cohesin, CTCF, and Mediator), a new paradigm in genome biology was established wherein genomes are organized around gene regulatory factors that govern cell identity.   Mediator binds to boundaries of chromosomal interaction domains and to proteins involved in DNA looping, RNA metabolism, chromatin remodeling, and actin assembly.  Mediator is a multi-unit molecular complex that plays a key role in transferring signals from transcriptional regulators to RNA polymerase II in eukaryotes.  By defining the organizational hierarchy of the genome, determining changes in chromatin organization associated with changes in cell identity, and describing chromatin organization within the context of linear genomic features (such as chromatin modifications and transcription factor binding) and architectural proteins (including Cohesin, CTCF, and Mediator), a new paradigm in genome biology was established wherein genomes are organized around gene regulatory factors that govern cell identity.  This suggests that Mediator plays a significant role in higher-order genome organization.  er with architectural proteins and transcriptional regulators, such as CTCF and Mediator, respectively, it contributes to genome organization at different scales and thereby affects transcription, DNA replication, and locus rearrangement.  Although  Loss of nuclear pore complex (NPC) proteins, transcription factors (TFs), histone modification enzymes, Mediator, and factors involved in mRNA export disrupts the physical interaction of chromosomal sites with NPCs.  Mediator functions as an integrator of transcriptional regulatory activity by interacting with DNA-bound transcription factors and with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to both activate and repress gene expression.  This study provides an extensive genome-wide view of Mediator's role in PIC formation, suggesting that Mediator coordinates multiple steps of a PIC assembly pathway.  Mediator is a large multiprotein complex conserved in all eukaryotes, which has a crucial coregulator function in transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II).  In this work, we utilised our large collection of conditional temperature-sensitive med17 mutants to investigate Mediator's role in coordinating preinitiation complex (PIC) formation in vivo at the genome level after a transfer to a non-permissive temperature for 45 minutes.  Our data suggest that high binding-affinity for Mediator is an important organizing feature in the transcriptional network that determines NSC identity.  These advances emphasize the importance of genomic proximity and nuclear organization for homology search and the critical role of homology search mediators in this process.  We demonstrate that Mediator selectively contributes to TBP recruitment or stabilization to chromatin.  Collectively, our data suggest that the essential function of Mediator is mediated by Head and Middle at core promoters, while Tail and CKM play regulatory roles.  Mediator is a highly conserved transcriptional coactivator organized into four modules, namely Tail, Middle, Head, and Kinase (CKM).  Mediator has been shown to affect multiple steps in transcription, including chromatin looping between enhancers and promoters, pre-initiation complex formation, transcriptional elongation, and mRNA splicing.  The Mediator complex regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to promoters.  Individual Mediator subunits participate in regulation of gene expression by the estrogen and androgen receptors and are altered in a number of endocrine cancers, including breast and prostate cancer.  Mediator is a conserved, multi-subunit macromolecular machine divided structurally into head, middle, and tail modules, along with a transiently associating kinase module.  The main function of Mediator is to transduce signals from the transcription activators bound to enhancer regions to the transcription machinery, which is assembled at promoters as the preinitiation complex (PIC) to control transcription initiation.  Novel roles of Mediator in the control of gene expression have also been revealed by showing its connection to the nuclear pore and linking Mediator to the regulation of gene positioning in the nuclear space.

Spt6 Is Essential for rRNA Synthesis by RNA Polymerase I.  Spt6 (suppressor of Ty6) has many roles in transcription initiation and elongation by RNA polymerase (Pol) II.  These effects are mediated through interactions with histones, transcription factors, and the RNA polymerase.  Two lines of evidence suggest that Spt6 also plays a role in rRNA synthesis.  We identify the histone H3-H4 chaperone Spt6 as the factor that mediates nucleosome reassembly onto the PHO5, PHO8, ADH2, ADY2, and SUC2 promoters during transcriptional repression.   Previous characterization of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Spt4, Spt5, and Spt6 proteins suggested that these proteins act as transcription factors that modify chromatin structure.  The SPT4, SPT5, and SPT6 gene products define a class of transcriptional repressors in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that are thought to function through their effects on chromatin assembly or stability.

It has been firmly established that mutations in the gene for fibrillin 1, FBN1, cause Marfan syndrome (MFS).  Mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1) cause Marfan syndrome and related connective tissue disorders (fibrillinopathies) that show autosomal dominant inheritance.  It is known that mutations in the fibrillin gene cause a heterogenous connective tissue disease called Marfan syndrome [2], so information on mechanical properties of microfibrils or their role in tissue function would be useful.

"[SOC]###context: Participation of Korean families at high risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer in BRCA1/2 genetic testing.  The prevalence of BRCA1/2 mutations in Korean ovarian cancer patients irrespective of the family history was significantly higher than previously reported.  Possible founder mutations in Korean ovarian cancer patients were identified.  Germline Mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in Korean Ovarian Cancer Patients: Finding Founder Mutations.  The assessment of BRCA1 and BRCA2 coding sequences to identify pathogenic mutations associated with inherited breast/ovarian cancer syndrome has provided a method to identify high-risk individuals, allowing them to seek preventative treatments and strategies.   Maximising survival: the main concern of women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer who undergo genetic testing for BRCA1/2.   Little is known about how women with hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer who test positive for a BRCA gene manage the impact of a positive test result on their everyday lives and in the longer term.  This study defined the experience and needs of women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and a positive BRCA test over time.  The strongest evidence was for rs1466785 in the NEIL2 (endonuclease VIII-like 2) gene (HR: 1. 09, 95% CI (1. 03-1. 16), p = 2. 7 × 10(-3)) for association with breast cancer risk in BRCA2 mutation carriers, and rs2304277 in the OGG1 (8-guanine DNA glycosylase) gene, with ovarian cancer risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers (HR: 1. 12 95%CI: 1. 03-1. 21, p = 4. 8 × 10(-3)).  Female BRCA (breast cancer gene)-1 and BRCA-2 mutations are significantly associated with risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers, in turn, associated with female infertility.   Large BRCA1 and BRCA2 genomic rearrangements in Polish high-risk breast and ovarian cancer families.  BRCA1 and BRCA2 are two major genes associated with familial breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility.  Until 2006, she supervised a diagnostic unit for BRCA gene testing at the Interdisciplinary Center for Hereditary Breast Cancer (Max Delbrück Center, Berlin, Germany).   Inherited BRCA gene mutations convey a high risk for breast and ovarian cancer, but current guidelines limit BRCA mutation testing to women with early-onset cancer and relatives of mutation-positive cases.   Women who carry a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation face a risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer at an earlier age than women without such a mutation.  In 2006, participants were recruited from Web sites for women with breast cancer or BRCA gene mutations.   About 20 % of hereditary breast cancers are caused by mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.  Since BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations may be spread throughout the gene, genetic testing is usually performed by direct sequencing of entire coding regions.  Suggestion of an association between BRCA2 c. 7806-2A>G and risk of breast cancer in males has emerged.   The presence of deleterious mutations in breast cancer (BRCA)-1 or BRCA-2 gene has a decisive influence on the development of various types of neoplasms, such as breast, ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal cancers.   OBJECTIVE: Female BRCA (breast cancer gene)-1 and BRCA-2 mutations are significantly associated with risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers, in turn, associated with female infertility.  BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are responsible for 5-10% of breast and ovarian cancer cases.  She was daughter of a woman, a carrier of BRCA 1 gene mutation, with early onset of breast cancer and positive family history. CONCLUSIONS: BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 gene mutations are of particular importance in the increasing risk of ovarian cancer and early onset of breast cancer as well as some other malignancies.  BACKGROUND: Women who are diagnosed with a deleterious mutation in either breast cancer (BRCA) gene have a high risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers at young ages.  We identified AJ individuals with breast and/or ovarian cancer undergoing hereditary breast/ovarian cancer risk assessment since 2006 without evidence of a deleterious mutation on BRCA gene sequencing who were screened for major gene rearrangements in BRCA1 and BRCA2.  Germline BRCA gene mutations are reportedly associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancers.  [Detection and occurrence of BRCA 1 gene mutation in patients with carcinoma of the breast and ovary].  We investigated the relationship between BRCA mutations and the distribution of familial cancers other than breast or ovary in high-risk breast cancer patients. PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER WHO HAD AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS WERE ENROLLED: reported family history of breast or ovarian cancer; 40 years of age or younger age at diagnosis; bilateral breast cancer; or male gender Mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2) are associated with increased risks for breast, ovarian, and other types of cancer. To review new evidence on the benefits and harms of risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for BRCA-related cancer in women. MEDLINE and PsycINFO between 2004 and 30 July 2013, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 2004 through the second quarter of 2013, Health Technology Assessment during the fourth quarter of 2012, Scopus, and reference lists. English-language studies about accuracy of risk assessment and benefits and harms of genetic counseling, genetic testing, and interventions to reduce cancer incidence and mortality.  The objective of this study was to assess the incidence of primary breast cancer (PBC) and contralateral breast cancer (CBC) in patients who had BRCA1/BRCA2-associated epithelial ovarian cancer (OC). From the database of the Rotterdam Family Cancer Clinic, patients who had BRCA-associated OC without a history of unilateral breast cancer (BC) (at risk of PBC; n = 79) or with a history of unilateral BC (at risk of CBC; n = 37) were selected Statistically significant earlier ages at diagnosis also were observed within subgroups of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, maternal inheritance, paternal inheritance, breast cancer only, and breast cancer-identified and ovarian cancer-identified families. Breast and ovarian cancers in BRCA mutation carriers appeared to be diagnosed at an earlier age in later generations The USPSTF also reviewed interventions aimed at reducing the risk for BRCA-related cancer in women with potentially harmful BRCA mutations, including intensive cancer screening, medications, and risk-reducing surgery. This recommendation applies to asymptomatic women who have not been diagnosed with BRCA-related cancer. The USPSTF recommends that primary care providers screen women who have family members with breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer with 1 of several screening tools designed to identify a family history that may be associated with an increased risk for potentially harmful mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA1 or BRCA2) If a woman bearing a mutation develops cancer in one breast, her risk of developing cancer in the other breast depends on the particular gene that is mutated and on her age at the onset of disease. About half of all monogenically determined carcinomas of the breast and ovary are due to a mutation in one or the other of the highly penetrant BRCA genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2) A value of RHR greater than 1 indicated elevated breast cancer risk; a value of RHR less than 1 indicated elevated ovarian cancer risk. Mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2. Breast and ovarian cancer risks. Among BRCA1 mutation carriers, 9052 women (46%) were diagnosed with breast cancer, 2317 (12%) with ovarian cancer, 1041 (5%) with breast and ovarian cancer, and 7171 (37%) without cancer This study defined the experience and needs of women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and a positive BRCA test over time. METHODS: A grounded theory approach was taken using qualitative interviews (n = 49) and reflective diaries.   Little is known about how women with hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer who test positive for a BRCA gene manage the impact of a positive test result on their everyday lives and in the longer term.  This study defined the experience and needs of women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and a positive BRCA test over time. A grounded theory approach was taken using qualitative interviews (n = 49) and reflective diaries.  Women with a harmful mutation in the BReast CAncer (BRCA) gene are at significantly increased risk of developing hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) during their lifetime, compared to those without.  Genetic testing for BRCA genes, associated with hereditary breast-ovarian cancer risk, is an accepted cancer control strategy.  Younger patients, those with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, and those diagnosed more recently were more likely to be BRCA tested.  Mutations in BRCA genes elevate risk for breast and ovarian cancer.  Observational studies of prophylactic surgeries report reduced risks for breast and ovarian cancer in mutation carriers. No data describe the range of risk associated with BRCA mutations, genetic heterogeneity, and moderating factors; studies conducted in highly selected populations contain biases; and information on adverse effects is incomplete. A primary care approach to screening for inherited breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility has not been evaluated, and evidence is lacking to determine benefits and harms for the general population.  We identified AJ individuals with breast and/or ovarian cancer undergoing hereditary breast/ovarian cancer risk assessment since 2006 without evidence of a deleterious mutation on BRCA gene sequencing who were screened for major gene rearrangements in BRCA1 and BRCA2.  For each proband, the pre-test probability of identifying a deleterious BRCA mutation was estimated using the Myriad II model.  We identified 108 affected individuals who underwent large rearrangement testing (80 breast cancer, 19 ovarian cancer, nine both breast and ovarian cancer).  Truncated proteins are easily discriminated from full size. RESULTS: Three BRCA 1 gene alterations were identified in the investigated group of women suffering from ovarian or breast cancer.  One asymptomatic person--carrier of BRCA 1 gene mutation--was identified in this study.  She was daughter of a woman, a carrier of BRCA 1 gene mutation, with early onset of breast cancer and positive family history. CONCLUSIONS: BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 gene mutations are of particular importance in the increasing risk of ovarian cancer and early onset of breast cancer as well as some other malignancies.  Germline BRCA gene mutations are reportedly associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancers.  Identification of BRCA mutations greatly improves the preventive strategies and management of breast cancer.  Statistically significant earlier ages at diagnosis also were observed within subgroups of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, maternal inheritance, paternal inheritance, breast cancer only, and breast cancer-identified and ovarian cancer-identified families. CONCLUSIONS: Breast and ovarian cancers in BRCA mutation carriers appeared to be diagnosed at an earlier age in later generations.  Truncated proteins are easily discriminated from full size. RESULTS: Three BRCA 1 gene alterations were identified in the investigated group of women suffering from ovarian or breast cancer.  However, some single risk factors without family histories (early-onset breast cancer, male breast cancer, or multiple organ cancers) may limit the utility of BRCA gene testing in the Korean population.  BRCA Mutations Increase Fertility in Families at Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Risk.  Because infertility is associated with breast and ovarian cancer risks, we hypothesized that the mutations in the BRCA gene may be associated with low response to fertility treatments.  Moreover, in families of breast cancer patients without BRCA mutations, breast cancer risk depends on the patient's age at diagnosis.  Among the 554 women who underwent genetic testing for BRCA mutation, 78 were found to have a deleterious mutation in the BRCA1 gene, and 54 had a mutation in the BRCA 2 gene.  Frequent recurrent mutations in the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility (BRCA) genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 among Hispanics, including a large rearrangement Mexican founder mutation (BRCA1 exon 9-12 deletion [ex9-12del]), suggest that an ancestry-informed BRCA-testing strategy could reduce disparities and promote cancer prevention by enabling economic screening for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer in Mexico.  Individuals who carry a BRCA gene mutation have increased lifetime risks of developing hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome-related cancers.  BRCA gene mutations have been well described to carry an increased risk of both breast and ovarian cancer.  Ovarian cancer among 8,005 women from a breast cancer family history clinic: no increased risk of invasive ovarian cancer in families testing negative for BRCA1 and BRCA2.  Women who were BRCA carriers, women who had a history of breast cancer, DCIS, or breast biopsy, or had a family history of ovarian cancer were more likely to have undergone surgery for cancer risk reduction.  Genetic testing for breast cancer susceptibility became a reality after two cancer predisposition genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, were identified.  Germline mutations in BRCA genes are associated with breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility.  We used person-years at risk to assess ovarian cancer rates in the study population, subdivided by genetic status (BRCA1, BRCA2, BRCA negative, BRCA untested) compared with the general population. 
###question: Could BRCA gene test used for breast and ovarian cancer risk?[EOC] [SOR]###response: Yes, BRCA gene test could be used for breast and ovarian cancer risk, as female BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are significantly associated with risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers. [EOR]"
"[SOC]###context: Somatic mosaicism and common genetic variation contribute to the risk of very-early-onset inflammatory bowel disease.  Very-early-onset inflammatory bowel disease (VEO-IBD) is a heterogeneous phenotype associated with a spectrum of rare Mendelian disorders.  Here, we perform whole-exome-sequencing and genome-wide genotyping in 145 patients (median age-at-diagnosis of 3. 5 years), in whom no Mendelian disorders were clinically suspected.  In five patients we detect a primary immunodeficiency or enteropathy, with clinical consequences (XIAP, CYBA, SH2D1A, PCSK1).  We also present a case study of a VEO-IBD patient with a mosaic de novo, pathogenic allele in CYBB.  The mutation is present in ~70% of phagocytes and sufficient to result in defective bacterial handling but not life-threatening infections.  Finally, we show that VEO-IBD patients have, on average, higher IBD polygenic risk scores than population controls (99 patients and 18,780 controls; P < 4 × 10-10), and replicate this finding in an independent cohort of VEO-IBD cases and controls (117 patients and 2,603 controls; P < 5 × 10-10).

"[SOC]###context: All forms of Bartter syndrome are characterized by hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and secondary hyperaldosteronism The mutations in the CLCNKB gene encoding the ClC-Kb chloride channel are responsible for Bartter syndrome type 3, one of the four variants of Bartter syndrome in the genetically based nomenclature.  Bartter syndrome (BS) is a hereditary disease, with an autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant mode of transmission.  It is characterized by salt wasting hypochloraemic, hypokalaemic Bartter syndrome Type III is caused by genetic alterations in the chloride channel kidney B (CLCNKB) gene and often presents in the first 2 years of life, known as classic Bartter syndrome.  Bartter syndrome encompasses a variety of inheritable renal tubular transport disorders characterized by hypokalemia and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis.  Classic Bartter syndrome and neonatal Bartter syndrome have defects in genes that affect transport channels in the ascending loop of Henle, where as in Gitleman syndrome the defect occurs in the transport channels of the distal convoluted tubule.  Bartter syndrome type III and congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract: an antenatal presentation.  Bartter's syndrome associated with hydramnios, prematurity, hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis.  Bartter syndrome (BS) is a rare renal tubular disorder presenting with hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, which is classified into five types It has been described in patients with chronic diarrhoea, eating disorders, laxative abuse and primary hyperaldosteronism; also occasionally in Bartter syndrome (BS), in which severe hypokalaemia accompanies significant renal sodium and water losses, though rarely in Gitelman syndrome (GS), in which there is equally severe hypokalaemia, but only modest sodium losses. We hypothesized that hypokalaemic nephropathy may not be due to potassium depletion per se, but persistently elevated circulating levels of aldosterone, possibly with superimposed episodes of renal hypoperfusion. We searched UK and European data sets to retrospectively compare serum and urinary parameters in patients with GS and BS.  Acquired Bartter-like syndrome (BLS), characterized by hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and normal kidney function, can be induced by diuretics or antibiotics lassic Bartter syndrome is a salt-wasting tubulopathy caused by mutations in the CLCNKB (chloride channel Kb) gene clinical features of two renal tubular disorders characterized by sodium and potassium wasting: Bartter syndrome and Gitelman syndrome Bartter syndrome is an autosomic recessive disease characterized by severe polyuria and sodium renal loss The term ""Bartter syndrome"" encompasses a group of closely related inherited tubulopathies characterized by markedly reduced NaCl transport by the distal nephron.    true Bartter's syndrome, diagnosed as a normotensive, hyperreninaemic, hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis with normal urine chloride excretion, low CH2O/(CH2O+CCl) ratio during maximal water diuresis and negative urine screen for diuretics Bartter's syndrome belongs to a group of hypokalemic renal channel diseases.  Hypokalemia due to renal potassium wasting in the absence of hypertension, moderate metabolic alkalosis, hyperreninism and hyperaldosteronism suggest the presence of Bartter's syndrome.   Inherited hypokalemic renal tubulopathies are differentiated into at least three clinical subtypes: (1) the Gitelman variant of Bartter syndrome (GS); (2) hyperprostaglandin E syndrome, the antenatal variant of Bartter syndrome (HPS/aBS); and (3) the classic Bartter syndrome (cBS).   Bartter syndrome, a group of autosomal recessive disorders that are characterized by markedly reduced or absent salt transport by the thick ascending limb of Henle.   Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes are characterized by hypokalemia, normal to low blood pressure and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis.  Bartter's syndrome has been used to describe a spectrum of inherited renal tubular disorders with hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis and overlapping and additional clinical and biochemical features.   antenatal variant of Bartter syndrome is characterized by a history of polyhydramnios, premature birth, metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia, polyuria and renal Most patients with Bartter syndrome have defects in transporters in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, such as the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter, NKCC2, or the ATP-sensitive potassium channel, ROMK.

The Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) Consortium is a collaborative network of researchers working together on a range of large-scale studies that integrate data from 70 institutions worldwide.  Organized into Working Groups that tackle questions in neuroscience, genetics, and medicine, ENIGMA studies have analyzed neuroimaging data from over 12,826 subjects.  In addition, data from 12,171 individuals were provided by the CHARGE consortium for replication of findings, in a total of 24,997 subjects.  By meta-analyzing results from many sites, ENIGMA has detected factors that affect the brain that no individual site could detect on its own, and that require larger numbers of subjects than any individual neuroimaging study has currently collected.  ENIGMA's first project was a genome-wide association study identifying common variants in the genome associated with hippocampal volume or intracranial volume.  Continuing work is exploring genetic associations with subcortical volumes (ENIGMA2) and white matter microstructure (ENIGMA-DTI).  Working groups also focus on understanding how schizophrenia, bipolar illness, major depression and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affect the brain.  We review the current progress of the ENIGMA Consortium, along with challenges and unexpected discoveries made on the way.

"[SOC]###context: Toward Single Cell Analysis by Plume Collimation in Laser Ablation Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry.  he advent of proteomics and genomics at a single-cell level has set the basis for an outstanding improvement in analytical technology and data acquisition.  The new-generation technology of single-cell analysis is able to better characterize a cell's population, identifying and differentiating outlier cells, in order to provide both a single-cell experiment and a corresponding bulk measurement, through the identification, quantification and characterization of all system biology aspects (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, degradomics and fluxomics).  The movement of omics into single-cell analysis represents a significant and outstanding shift.  Laser ablation electrospray ionization (LAESI) is a novel method for the direct imaging of biological tissues by mass spectrometry.  By performing ionization in the ambient environment, this technique enables in vivo studies with potential for single-cell analysis.  Other approaches for MS-based chemical imaging and profiling include those based on near-field laser ablation and inductively-coupled plasma MS analysis, which offer complementary capabilities for subcellular chemical imaging and profiling.  Mass spectrometry imaging and profiling of single cells.  his is rapidly changing with the recent examples of single cell genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics.  The rate of change is expected to accelerate owing to emerging technologies that range from micro/nanofluidics to microfabricated interfaces for mass spectrometry to third- and fourth-generation automated DNA sequencers Single-cell analysis (SCA) has been increasingly recognized as the key technology for the elucidation of cellular functions, which are not accessible from bulk measurements on the population level.  Thus far, SCA has been achieved by miniaturization of established engineering concepts to match the dimensions of a single cell Single-cell proteomic chip for profiling intracellular signaling pathways in single tumor cells.  The amount of single proteins in single cells can be as low as one copy per cell and is for most proteins in the attomole range or below; usually considered as insufficient for proteomic analysis.  n Arabidopsis thaliana, we have successfully identified nine unique proteins in a single-cell sample and 56 proteins from a pool of 15 single-cell samples from glucosinolate-rich S-cells by nanoLC-MS/MS proteomic analysis, thus establishing the proof-of-concept for true single-cell proteomic analysis A first step towards practical single cell proteomics: a microfluidic antibody capture chip with TIRF detection.

"[SOC]###context: We describe the Phase II HapMap, which characterizes over 3. 1 million human single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in 270 individuals from four geographically diverse populations and includes 25-35% of common SNP variation in the populations surveyed The International Haplotype Map Project (HapMap) has provided an essential database for studies of human population genetics and genome-wide association.  Phases I and II of the HapMap project generated genotype data across ∼3 million SNP loci in 270 individuals representing four populations.  .  A haplotype map (HapMap), aimed at describing these variation patterns across the entire genome, has been recently developed by the International HapMap Consortium.  .  We discuss in the same context the haplotype map project (HapMap) as a tool to facilitate the study of possible associations of genome changes and common diseases.  The ""HapMap"" project is now underway to characterize patterns of LD in the human genome.  One of the goals of the International HapMap Project is the identification of common haplotypes in genes.  One of the particular important projects is The International HapMap Project which provides the catalogue of human genetic variation for disease association studies.  A key goal of the HapMap Project is to enable identification of tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that capture a substantial portion of common human genetic variability while requiring only a small fraction of SNPs to be genotyped [International HapMap Consortium, 2005: Nature 437:1299-1320].  The International HapMap Consortium undertook an effort to catalog all common variation across the genome (variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of at least 5% in one or more ethnic groups).  al genome collaborations, such as HapMap and the Welcome Trust Case-Control Consortium single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mapping project have identified common genetic variations in diseases of major public health importance.  Such genetic s To facilitate evaluation of existing evidence of association and further work, we supplemented the extensive genotype data, available through the International HapMap Project (HapMap), about DTNBP1 by specifically typing all associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms reported in each of the studies of the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH)-derived HapMap sample (CEU).  In this chapter, we will demonstrate how to use the HapMap resource and the Haploview program to process and analyze genetic data from HapMap, to evaluate LD relations between SNPs, and to select tagging SNPs to be examined in disease association studies.  With the availability of the HapMap--a resource which describes common patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in four different human population samples, we now have a powerful tool to help dissect the role of genetic variation in the biology of the genome.  Although our SNP selection was based on HapMap data, which is a subset of all common SNPs, these panels effectively capture the majority of all common variation and provide high power to detect risk alleles that are not represented in the HapMap data.  Our results demonstrate that the HapMap CEU samples provide an adequate basis for tag SNP selection in Finnish individuals, without the need to create a map specifically for the Finnish population, and suggest that the four-population HapMap data will provide useful information for tag SNP selection beyond the specific populations from which they were sampled.  RESULTS: For each SNP, the SCAN database provides: (i) summary information from eQTL mapping of HapMap SNPs to gene expression (evaluated by the Affymetrix exon array) in the full set of HapMap CEU (Caucasians from UT, USA) and YRI (Yoruba people from Ibadan, Nigeria) samples; (ii) LD information, in the case of a HapMap SNP, including what genes have variation in strong LD (pairwise or multilocus LD) with the variant and how well the SNP is covered by different high-throughput platforms; (iii) summary information available from public databases (e. g.  The HapMap project is one of the largest public resources of human single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), characterizing over 3 million SNPs genotyped in over 1000 individuals.  Then, we study how well the HapMap SNPs capture the untyped SNPs in the region.  HapMap provides linkage disequilibrium (LD) information on a sample of 3. 7 million SNPs that can be used for tag SNP selection in whole-genome association studies.  INTRODUCTIONThe primary goal of the International Haplotype Map Project has been to develop a haplotype map of the human genome that describes the common patterns of genetic variation, in order to accelerate the search for the genetic causes of human disease.

RECENT FINDINGS: Novel therapies, not dependent on a functioning LDLR include lomitapide and mipomersen, which decrease hepatic apolipoprotein B secretion, and evinacumab, directed at the angiopoietin like-3 protein (ANGPLT-3).  Multiple ANGPLT3 inhibitors (evinacumab, IONIS-ANGPTL3-LRx, ARO-ANG3) effectuate TG reductions up to 70% with concomitant potent reduction in all other apoB containing lipoprotein fractions.  Moreover, regarding TG a monoclonal antibody called evinacumab and an antisense-oligonucleotide against ANGPTL3 showed effective TG-lowering.   Current therapies reduce plaque volume, but targeting all apoB-containing lipoproteins with intensive combinations that include alirocumab or evinacumab, monoclonal antibodies against cholesterol-regulating proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 and angiopoietin-like protein 3, may provide more benefit.

"[SOC]###context: The role of EZH2 in the regulation of the activity of matrix metalloproteinases in prostate cancer cells EZH2 plays an active role in this process by repressing the expression of TIMP2 and TIMP3 in prostate cancer cells The TIMP genes are derepressed by knockdown of EZH2 expression in human prostate cancer cells but repressed by overexpression of EZH2 in benign human prostate epithelial cells.  Overexpression of EZH2 confers an invasive phenotype on benign prostate epithelial cells EZH2 knockdown markedly reduces the proteolytic activity of MMP-9, thereby decreasing the invasive activity of prostate cancer cells he transcriptional repression of the TIMP genes by EZH2 may be a major mechanism to shift the MMPs/TIMPs balance in favor of MMP activity and thus to promote ECM degradation and subsequent invasion of prostate cancer cells.  Expression levels of the novel tumor and metastasis suppressor Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) have been shown to correlate negatively with those of EZH2 in breast and prostate cell lines as well as in clinical cancer tissues Polycomb protein EZH2 regulates tumor invasion via the transcriptional repression of the metastasis suppressor RKIP in breast and prostate cancer Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), which encodes the histone methyltransferase component of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), is overexpressed widely in breast and prostate cancers and epigenetically silences tumor suppressor genes However, the roles and underlying mechanisms of EZH2 in prostate cancer stem cells (PCSCs) remain unknown c-Myc, EZH2 and p27 were defined to modulate the behavior of prostate cancer with pro-tumoral or anti-tumoral effects and had ability in predicting prostate cancer progression, but the research of their co-expression value of prognosis is rarely Composite index of c-Myc, EZH2, and p27 can be valued as powerful prognosis parameter for intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients after the surgery, and postoperative adjuvant therapy can be adopted accordingly.  EZH2, an epigenetic driver of prostate cancer.  The histone methyltransferase EZH2 has been in the limelight of the field of cancer epigenetics for a decade now since it was first discovered to exhibit an elevated expression in metastatic prostate cancer a comprehensive overview of EZH2 in the context of prostate cancer EZH2 dependent H3K27me3 is involved in epigenetic silencing of ID4 in prostate cancer ChIP data on prostate cancer tissue specimens and cell lines suggested EZH2 occupancy and H3K27Me3 marks on the ID4 promoter Collectively, our data indicate a PRC2 dependent mechanism in ID4 promoter silencing in prostate cancer through recruitment of EZH2 and a corresponding increase in H3K27Me3.  Increased EZH2 but decreased ID4 expression in prostate cancer strongly supports this model.  The histone methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) has recently attracted considerable attention because of its dysregulation in prostate cancer (PCa) and its important function in PCa development.   Autoregulatory feedback loop of EZH2/miR-200c/E2F3 as a driving force for prostate cancer development Amounts of both EZH2 messenger RNA and EZH2 protein are increased in metastatic prostate cancer; in addition, clinically localized prostate cancers that express higher concentrations of EZH2 show a poorer prognosis.  The data show that amplification of the EZH2 gene is rare in early prostate cancer, whereas a fraction of late-stage tumors contains the gene amplification leading to the overexpression of the gene, thus indicating the importance of EZH2 in the progression of prostate cancer.  EZH2 expression in prostate cancer correlates with progression to hormone-refractory and metastatic disease, but it is unknown whether EZH2 plays a specific role in the acquisition of an advanced prostate cancer phenotype.  Although prior studies in prostate cancer have revealed a number of possible mechanisms of EZH2 upregulation, these changes cannot account for the overexpression EZH2 in many primary prostate cancers, nor in most cases of high grade PIN.  As a result, five EZH2 peptides recognized by IgG (EZH2 120-128, EZH2 165-174, EZH2 569-577, EZH2 665-674, and EZH2 699-708) were frequently detected in the plasma of prostate cancer patients.  Thus, dysregulated expression of EZH2 may be involved in the progression of prostate cancer, as well as being a marker that distinguishes indolent prostate cancer from those at risk of lethal progression.  These results link two major pathways in prostate cancer by providing two additional and complementary Myc-regulated mechanisms by which EZH2 upregulation occurs and is enforced during prostatic carcinogenesis.  EZH2 promotes prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness.  EZH2 promotes proliferation and invasiveness of prostate cancer cells.  The Polycomb Group protein EZH2 is implicated in prostate cancer progression.  The polycomb group protein EZH2 is involved in progression of prostate cancer.  Mutation screen and association study of EZH2 as a susceptibility gene for aggressive prostate cancer.  Expression changes in EZH2, but not in BMI-1, SIRT1, DNMT1 or DNMT3B are associated with DNA methylation changes in prostate cancer.  The gene for polycomb group protein enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is amplified in late-stage prostate cancer.  Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a kind of transcriptional repressor, is reportedly over-expressed in metastatic prostate cancer.  IgGs reactive to three EZH2 peptides (EZH2-243 to -252, EZH2-291 to -299, and EZH2-735 to -;742) were detected in the plasma of almost half of prostate cancer patients.  Amounts of both EZH2 messenger RNA and EZH2 protein are increased in metastatic prostate cancer; in addition, clinically localized prostate cancers that express higher concentrations of EZH2 show a poorer prognosis.  Overexpression of EZH2 has been associated with the invasion and progression of malignant cancers, especially with the progression of prostate cancer.  Antigens overexpressed in metastatic prostate cancer are appropriate targets in anti-cancer immunotherapy, and one candidate is the polycomb group protein enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2).   Cytoplasmic EZH2 is expressed at low levels in benign prostate epithelial cells and over-expressed in prostate cancer cells.  Cytoplasmic EZH2 expression levels correlate with nuclear EZH2 expression in prostate cancer samples.  DNMT1 or DNMT3B are associated with DNA methylation changes in prostate cancer.  EZH2:ECAD status was statistically significantly associated with prostate cancer recurrence in a training set of 103 patients (relative risk [RR] = 2. 52, a positive EZH2:ECAD status) was the biomarker combination that was most strongly associated with the recurrence of prostate cancer.  PcG proteins EZH2, BMI1, and RING1 are associated with adverse pathologic features and clinical PSA recurrence of prostate cancer.  Immunohistochemistry results were evaluated in conjunction with clinical parameters associated with prostate cancer progression, Elevation of the chromatin repression factor enhancer of zeste homolog (EZH2) is associated with progression and poor prognosis in several human cancers including prostate cancer.  Various proteins (α2-integrin, α6-integrin, CD117, CD133, EZH2, OCT3/4) are associated with a prostate cancer stem cell phenotype in cell lines and xenografts.  Increased expression of EZH2 has been associated previously with invasive growth and aggressive clinical behavior in prostate and breast cancer, EZH2:ECAD status was statistically significantly associated with prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy and may be useful in defining a cohort of high-risk patients.  Immunohistochemistry results were evaluated in conjunction with clinical parameters associated with prostate cancer progression, including tumor stage, Gleason score, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level.  EZH2 expression is associated with high proliferation rate and aggressive tumor subgroups in cutaneous melanoma and cancers of the endometrium, prostate, and breast.  Moderate or strong expression of EZH2 coupled with at most moderate expression of ECAD (i. e. , a positive EZH2:ECAD status) was the biomarker combination that was most strongly associated with the recurrence of prostate cancer.  Cytoplasmic EZH2 expression levels correlate with nuclear EZH2 expression in prostate cancer samples. 
###question: Is EZH2 associated with prostate cancer?[EOC] [SOR]###response: EZH2 is an epigenetic driver of prostate cancer.  EZH2 dependent H3K27me3 is involved in epigenetic silencing of ID4 in prostate cancer.  EZH2 plays an active role in this process by repressing the expression of TIMP2 and TIMP3 in prostate cancer cells.  EZH2 knockdown markedly reduces the proteolytic activity of MMP-9, thereby decreasing the invasive activity of prostate cancer cells.  Composite index of c-Myc, EZH2, and p27 can be valued as powerful prognosis parameter for intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients after the surgery, and postoperative adjuvant therapy can be adopted accordingly.

"[SOC]###context: Direct reprogramming of human cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs) into cardiomyocytes may hold great potential for this purpose.  We reported previously that induced cardiomyocyte-like cells (iCMs) can be directly generated from mouse cardiac fibroblasts in vitro and vivo by transduction of three transcription factors: Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5, collectively termed GMT.  Cardiac fibroblasts can be reprogrammed to cardiomyocyte-like cells by the introduction of three transcription factors: Gata4, Mef2c and Tbx5 (collectively referred to here as GMT).  Here we describe a detailed step-by-step protocol for in vitro cardiac reprogramming using retroviruses encoding GMT.  Overexpression of transcription factors MYOCD and SRF alone or in conjunction with Mesp1 and SMARCD3 enhanced the basal but necessary cardio-inducing effect of the previously reported GATA4, TBX5, and MEF2C.   Using calcium activity as our primary outcome measure, we compared several published combinations of transcription factors along with novel combinations in mouse embryonic fibroblasts.  The most effective combination consisted of Hand2, Nkx2. 5, Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 (HNGMT).  This combination is >50-fold more efficient than GMT alone and produces iCMs with cardiomyocyte marker expression, robust calcium oscillation, and spontaneous beating that persist for weeks following inactivation of reprogramming factors.  Here we show that four human cardiac transcription factors, including GATA binding protein 4, Hand2, T-box5, and myocardin, and two microRNAs, miR-1 and miR-133, activated cardiac marker expression in neonatal and adult human fibroblasts.   We found that functional cardiomyocytes can be directly induced from fibroblasts by a combination of three cardiac transcription factors, Gata4, Mef2c and Tbx5, in vitro and in vivo.  To assess the efficiency of direct fibroblast reprogramming via viral overexpression of GATA4, Mef2c, and Tbx5 (GMT).    In addition, transplantation of GMT infected CFs into injured mouse hearts resulted in decreased cell survival with minimal induction of cardiomyocyte genes.  Here, to identify a cardiac transcription factor combination facilitating mouse fibroblast reprogramming into cardiomyocytes, we directly screened all triplet combinations of 10 candidate factors combined with a Q-PCR assay reporting induction of multiple cardiac-specific genes.  Through this screening method the combination of Tbx5, Mef2c, and Myocd was identified to upregulate a broader spectrum of cardiac genes compared to the combination of Tbx5, Mef2c, and Gata4 that was recently shown to induce reprogramming of fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes.  We reported previously that cardiac fibroblasts,which represent 50%of the cells in the mammalian heart, can be directly reprogrammed to adult cardiomyocyte-like cells in vitro by the addition of Gata4, Mef2c and Tbx5 (GMT).  Here, we report that a combination of three developmental transcription factors (i. e. , Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5) rapidly and efficiently reprogrammed postnatal cardiac or dermal fibroblasts directly into differentiated cardiomyocyte-like cells.  Induced cardiomyocytes expressed cardiac-specific markers, had a global gene expression profile similar to cardiomyocytes, and contracted spontaneously.  More recently, we showed that reprogramming of cardiac fibroblasts to cardiomyocyte-like cells in vivo after coronary artery ligation using three cardiac transcription factors (Gata4/Mef2c/Tbx5) offers an alternative approach to regenerate heart muscle.  Here, we report that a combination of three developmental transcription factors (i. e. , Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5) rapidly and efficiently reprogrammed postnatal cardiac or dermal fibroblasts directly into differentiated cardiomyocyte-like cells.

"[SOC]###context: Two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled feasibility trials of minocycline in ALS were conducted.   This pilot study shows that minocycline and riluzole can be taken safely together.  Further trials are needed to assess efficacy of such treatment.  It reduces apoptosis in mouse models of Huntington's disease and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and is in clinical trial for sporadic ALS.  Efficacy of minocycline in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a phase III randomised trial.  FINDINGS: ALSFRS-R score deterioration was faster in the minocycline group than in the placebo group (-1. 30 vs -1. 04 units/month, 95% CI for difference -0. 44 to -0. 08; p=0. 005).

Polo-like kinase 2 regulates selective autophagic α-synuclein clearance and suppresses its toxicity in vivo Collectively, our findings demonstrate that PLK2 is a previously undescribed regulator of α-synuclein turnover and that modulating its kinase activity could be a viable target for the treatment of synucleinopathies.   α-Synuclein increased PLK2 levels and GSK-3β activity and increased the levels of phosphorylated α-Synuclein and Tau Polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2) phosphorylates alpha-synuclein at serine 129 in central nervous system Several neurological diseases, including Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, are characterized by the accumulation of alpha-synuclein phosphorylated at Ser-129 (p-Ser-129) Here we submit evidence that polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2, also known as serum-inducible kinase or SNK) is a principle contributor to alpha-synuclein phosphorylation at Ser-129 in neurons.

"[SOC]###context: All DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases contain a single conserved cysteine.  It has been proposed that this cysteine initiates catalysis by attacking the C6 of cytosine and thereby activating the normally inert C5 position.  Kinetic and catalytic mechanism of HhaI methyltransferase.  Kinetic and catalytic properties of the DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase HhaI are described.  With poly(dG-dC) as substrate, the reaction proceeds by an equilibrium (or processive) ordered Bi-Bi mechanism in which DNA binds to the enzyme first, followed by S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet).  After methyl transfer, S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) dissociates followed by methylated DNA.  Our studies reveal that the catalytic mechanism of DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferases involves attack of the C6 of substrate cytosines by an enzyme nucleophile and formation of a transient covalent adduct.  Catalytic mechanism of DNA-(cytosine-C5)-methyltransferases revisited: covalent intermediate formation is not essential for methyl group transfer by the murine Dnmt3a enzyme.  We propose that correct positioning of the flipped base and the cofactor and binding to the transition state of methyl group transfer are the most important roles of the Dnmt3a enzyme in the catalytic cycle of methyl group transfer.  Co-transfections of reporter plasmids and plasmids encoding the catalytic domain of the murine Dnmt3a DNA methyltransferase lead to inhibition of reporter gene expression.  As Dnmt3a mutants with C-->A and E-->A exchanges in the conserved PCQ and ENV motifs in the catalytic center of the enzyme also cause repression, we checked for their catalytic activity in vitro.  In contrast, enzyme variants carrying E-->A, E-->D or E-->Q exchanges of the ENV glutamate are catalytically almost inactive, demonstrating that this residue has a central function in catalysis.  Therefore, covalent complex formation is not essential in the reaction mechanism of Dnmt3a.  We propose that correct positioning of the flipped base and the cofactor and binding to the transition state of methyl group transfer are the most important roles of the Dnmt3a enzyme in the catalytic cycle of methyl group transfer.  Our results point to a possible connection between the catalytic mechanism of C5 Mtases and of enzymes that transfer methyl groups to N(4) of cytosine.  Previous X-ray crystallographic studies have revealed that the catalytic domain of a DNA methyltransferase (Mtase) generating C5-methylcytosine bears a striking structural similarity to that of a Mtase generating N6-methyladenine.  Spontaneous and reversible proton transfer between a conserved Glu in the active site and cytosine N3 at the transition state was observed in our simulations, revealing the chemical participation of this Glu residue in the catalytic mechanism.  The mechanism of DNA cytosine-5-methylation catalyzed by the bacterial M. HhaI enzyme has been considered as a stepwise nucleophilic addition of Cys-81-S- to cytosine C6 followed by C5 nucleophilic replacement of the methyl of S-adenosyl-L-methionine to produce 5-methyl-6-Cys-81-S-5,6-dihydrocytosine.  Hydroxide at 10(-7) mole fraction (pH = 7) is shown to be sufficient for the required catalysis.  On the basis of amino acid sequence alignments and structural data of related enzymes, we have performed a mutational analysis of 14 amino acid residues in the catalytic domain of the murine Dnmt3a DNA-(cytosine C5)-methyltransferase.  We demonstrate that Phe50 (motif I) and Glu74 (motif II) are important for AdoMet binding and catalysis.  D96A (motif III) showed reduced AdoMet binding but increased activity under conditions of saturation with S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet), indicating that the contact of Asp96 to AdoMet is not required for catalysis.  R130A displayed a strong reduction in catalytic activity and a complete change in flanking sequence preferences, indicating that Arg130 has an important role in the DNA interaction of Dnmt3a.  While Asn167 might contribute to the positioning of residues from motif VI, according to structural data Arg202 has a role in catalysis of cytosine-C5 methyltransferases.  The R295A variant was catalytically inactive most likely because of destabilization of the hinge sub-domain of the protein.  These two methyltransferases recognize CpG and GCGC sequences, respectively, and transfer a methyl group to the C5 atom of cytosine (C).  Most prokaryotic (cytosine-5)-DNA methyltransferases increase the frequency of deamination at the cytosine targeted for methylation in vitro in the absence of the cofactor S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) or the reaction product S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy).  The target (methylatable) cytosine, if flipped out of the double helical DNA as seen for DNA methyltransferases that generate 5-methylcytosine, would fit into the concave active site next to the AdoMet.  These methylation patterns are established and maintained by DNA cytosine-5 methyltransferase (MTase), a approximately 1500 amino acid enzyme containing a regulatory N-terminal domain and a catalytic C-terminal domain.  These results lend strong support to a catalytic mechanism in which an enzyme sulfhydryl group undergoes Michael addition to the C5-C6 double bond, thus activating position C-5 of the substrate DNA cytosine residue for electrophilic attack by the methyl donor SAM.  2'-Deoxyoligonucleotides with 5-fluorocytosine residues incorporated at specific positions of the nucleotide sequence are tools of great potential in the study of the catalytic mechanism by which DNA cytosine methyltransferases methylate the 5-position of DNA cytosine residues in specific sequence contexts.  The enzyme has Mr 130 000, and introduces methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine into the 5 position of cytosines in DNA.

The rep has been suggested that tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is a candidate mediator of insulin resistance in obesity, as it is overexpressed in the adipose tissues of rodents and humans and it blocks the action of insulin in cultured cells and whole animals.  To inv The proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) plays a central role in low-grade adipose tissue inflammation and development of insulin resistance during obesity.  In  BACKGROUND: In obesity, increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha level is involved in the development of insulin re Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha plays a central role in the state of insulin resistance associated with obesity.  It OBJECTIVE: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is thought to mediate, in part, the link between obesity and insulin resistance, and women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have raised serum TNF-alpha concentratio Recent studies have shown that the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) system is implicated in the insulin resistance of human obesity.  Pla Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is one of the candidate mediators of insulin resistance associated with obesity, a major risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes.  The The cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) was proposed to mediate obesity related insulin resistance upon production in fat cells and to participate in tissue remodelling leading to vascular complications upon being released by macrophages.  To  The polymorpism of the TNF-a-308 gene is also involved in the development of obesity-related insulin resistance, therefore, we investigated whether the IRS-1 and TNF-a polymorphism can predict conversion to insulin resistance and obesity parameters in children with obesity. MATERIAL AND In spite of the fact that this cytokine (also known as ""cachectin"") has been related to many of the metabolic abnormalities associated with cachexia, recent studies suggest that TNF may also have a central role in obesity modulating energy expenditure, fat deposition and insulin resistance.  It has been suggested that tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is a candidate mediator of insulin resistance in obesity, as it is overexpressed in the adipose tissues of rodents and humans and it blocks the action of insulin in cultured cells and whole animals.  In this study, we have analyzed the in vivo role of TNF signaling from p55 [TNF receptor (TNFR) 1] and p75 (TNFR 2) TNFR in the development of insulin resistance by generating genetically obese mice (ob/ob) lacking p55 or p75 TNFRs.  In this cross-sectional study (n = 498; 258 males, 240 females), association of genotypes (PCR–RFLP) of 11-βHSD1 and TNF-α were analyzed with obesity [BMI ≥ 25 kg/m(2), percentage body fat (%BF by DEXA); subcutaneous and intra-abdominal fat area (L(2-3) level by single slice MRI) in a sub sample] and insulin resistance.  11-β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11-βHSD1), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and their role in obesity, regional adiposity and insulin resistance has been sparsely evaluated.  To investigate the role of TNF-alpha in obesity and insulin resistance, we have generated obese mice with a targeted null mutation in the gene encoding TNF-alpha and those encoding the two receptors for TNF-alpha.  Inhibition of insulin receptor signaling by TNF: potential role in obesity and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.  Increased production of TNF by adipocytes, however, may contribute to insulin resistance in obesity and in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).  TNF has been shown to inhibit insulin-simulated tyrosine phosphorylation of both the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and to stimulate downregulation of the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter, GLUT4, in adipocytes.  Inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can contribute to insulin resistance.  TNF, but not hyperinsulinemia or hyperglycemia, is a key driver of obesity-induced monocytosis revealing that inflammatory monocytes correlate with insulin in obese male mice.  It is not clear if the extent of obesity, hyperinsulinemia, or hyperglycemia, underpins changes in cellular immunity during diet-induced obesity.  Overall, TNF may function to make the subject less obese by inhibiting LPL and rendering the animal more insulin resistant.  TNF is expressed at higher levels in muscle cells of insulin-resistant subjects, and TNF may inhibit LPL expression.  When insulin-resistant rodents were injected with anti-TNF binding protein, insulin action improved, suggesting a link between insulin resistance and TNF.  These results indicate a role for TNF-alpha in obesity and particularly in the insulin resistance and diabetes that often accompany obesity.  Recent studies in animal models have indicated that TNF-alpha plays an important role in mediating the insulin resistance of obesity through its overexpression in fat tissue.  TNF-alpha may play a role in mediating insulin resistance associated with obesity.  These results indicate that TNF-alpha is an important mediator of insulin resistance in obesity through its effects on several important sites of insulin action.  Recent data have suggested a key role for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in the insulin resistance of obesity and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).  Although tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) has been implicated in the insulin resistance associated with obesity, its role in other disorders of obesity is largely unknown.  Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is overexpressed in obesity and is a candidate mediator of obesity-induced insulin resistance.  Such findings support the hypothesis that TNF is a mediator of obesity-linked insulin resistance.  This review will summarize the available knowledge on the role of TNF-alpha in obesity and related processes and the potential implications of the above in the development of new therapeutic approaches for obesity and insulin resistance. 
###question: What is the role of TNF in obesity?[EOC] [SOR]###response: The role of TNF in obesity is not fully understood, but it is thought to play a major role in adipose tissue formation and fat storage.  TNF-alpha is a protein that has been shown to increase fat storage in fat cells.  It is also thought to have a role in insulin resistance. [EOR]"

"[SOC]###context: In Japan, intravenous alteplase, a recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA), was approved for an indication of ischemic stroke in 2005 on the basis of the results of a clinical trial with a unique dose of the drug (0. 6 mg/kg).   Alteplase appears to show efficacy for treatment of thrombus-related venous catheter occlusion in pediatric patients; however, data regarding its use in occluded dialysis catheters are limited.  The trials used to support Food and Drug Administration approval of alteplase for central venous catheter (CVC) occlusions generally had low pediatric enrollment; however, additional small studies are available that support use of alteplase for this indication in children.  To review the literature pertaining to the efficacy of alteplase for restoration of patency of occluded venous and dialysis catheters in pediatric patients.   Intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue Plasminogen Activator improves outcomes in patients treated early after stroke but at the risk of causing intracranial hemorrhage.  Intravenous alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) is the only approved thrombolytic agent at present indicated for acute ischaemic stoke.  This paper presents a summary of the evidence review group report into the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of alteplase for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke, in accordance with the licensed indication, based upon the evidence submission from the manufacturer to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) as part of the single technology appraisal (STA) process.  The submitted clinical evidence included several randomised controlled trials indicating that, in highly selected patients, alteplase administered at a licensed dose within 3 hours of the onset of acute ischaemic stroke is associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of death or dependency at 3 months compared with placebo, despite a significantly increased risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage within the first 7-10 days.  Data from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) trial suggest that the benefit of treatment is sustained at 6 and 12 months.  The guidance issued by NICE in April 2007 as a result of the STA states that alteplase is recommended for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke only when used by physicians trained and experienced in the management of acute stroke and in centres with the required facilities.  Because of the risk of hemorrhage, especially in the brain, thrombolytic therapy with intravenous alteplase is restricted by guidelines, and only a small number of selected patients are being treated.  Alteplase can be given to patients with cervical artery dissection, seizure at onset and evidence of acute ischemia on brain imaging, and after carefully weighing risk and benefit in pregnancy and during menstruation.   Alteplase is the first thrombolytic drug to be approved in France for the treatment of ischaemic stroke within three hours of symptom onset.  However, the Cochrane systematic review of thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke suggests that alteplase is the most promising treatment for acute ischaemic stroke.    To determine whether cryopreserved solutions of the thrombolytic agent alteplase could be used as a safe, effective, and economically reasonable alternative to urokinase in patients presenting with occluded central venous access devices (CVADs).  Alteplase has been reported as an efficacious alternative to urokinase for treatment of occluded CVADs.   Patients presenting with occluded CVADs received a sufficient volume of the thawed alteplase solution to fill the occluded catheter(s).   Cryopreserved 1-mg/mL aliquots of alteplase are safe and effective in the clearance of occluded CVADs when stored at -20 degrees C for 30 days.  The ability to cryopreserve alteplase aliquots makes it an economically reasonable alternative to urokinase in the setting of CVAD occlusion.  Of the thrombolytic agents and therapeutic protocols in use, alteplase 100 mg/2 hours seems to be the best compromise between the risk of bleeding and efficacy in reducing pulmonary resistances by 30 to 40% and relatively early pulmonary revascularisation of 40-50%.   To explore the best regimen of treatment for acute pulmonary embolism(APE), and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2-h infusion of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator, Alteplase (rt-PA) and urokinase(UK).   A 2 h regimen of rt-PA or UK showed reliable efficacy and safety for treatment of APE.  The indication of thrombolytic therapy can be extended.  Tissue type plasminogen activator is available, through recombinant technology, for thrombolytic use as alteplase.  Alteplase has been used successfully in evolving myocardial infarction (MI) to reopen occluded coronary arteries.   Alteplase is most effective when given early in MI and is probably ineffective when given 12 h after the onset of symptoms.  The effectiveness of alteplase in MI can be increased by front loading with a bolus of 15 mg, followed by an infusion of 50 mg over 30 min and 35 mg over 60 min.  A reduced dose of alteplase to increase coronary artery patency prior to angioplasty may be useful in MI.  An exciting new indication for the use of alteplase is in stroke, where it has become the first beneficial intervention.  Alteplase is used to reopen occluded cerebral vessels but is associated with an increased risk of intracerebral haemorrhage.  Alteplase is beneficial if given within 3 h of the onset of stroke but not after this time period.  Clinical trials have not established a role for alteplase in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes or deep vein thrombosis.  However, alteplase is useful in treating pulmonary thromboembolism and peripheral vascular disease.  Our aim was to design and evaluate a new and easily administered recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) regimen for thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) based on established pharmacokinetic data that improve the reperfusion success rate.   Rapid restoration of Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grade 3 flow is a primary predictor of mortality after thrombolysis in AMI.  The 60-min alteplase thrombolysis in AMI protocol achieved a TIMI grade 3 patency rate of 81. 1% at 90 min with no indication of an increased bleeding hazard; it was associated with a 1. 2% overall mortality rate.  Alteplase is now firmly established as a treatment of choice in the management of acute myocardial infarction.  The efficacy of intravenous alteplase in the treatment of pulmonary thromboembolism has also been established and appears to be similar to that of streptokinase and urokinase in this indication and in arterial thrombotic occlusion.  However, its use in this latter indication and in other vascular disorders has not been as extensively documented.  Although trials demonstrating the efficacy of intravenous alteplase in patients with deep vein thrombosis and intra-arterial alteplase in patients with arterial thrombotic occlusion exist, reliable data on the efficacy of the fibrinolytic in ischaemic stroke and intracranial haemorrhage are scarce.  Further, preliminary data suggest efficacy in the therapy of deep vein thrombosis and arterial thrombotic occlusion, and alteplase has a proven place in the fibrinolytic treatment of pulmonary thromboembolism.  The non-antigenic competitor for these two compounds for the indication of MI is alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, rt-PA).   In the framework of tailored thrombolytic therapy, alteplase or urokinase appear to be the drugs of choice in these patients.  Patients with a recent (less than 10 days) proximal deep vein thrombosis of the leg or pelvis are candidates for thrombolysis as the major benefit over heparin seems to be the prevention of the postphlebitic limb, an aim which is still not proven in a satisfactory manner.  Nonocclusive thrombi appear to lyse more readily than occlusive thrombi.  For this indication the optimal dose regimens for the three thrombolytic drugs (streptokinase, urokinase, alteplase) are not established.   To save 1 year of life, the costs of thrombolytic therapy using intravenous streptokinase, alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator; rt-PA) or anistreplase (anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex) under standard restricted indication criteria, vary from 1000 pounds British sterling to 1700 pounds British sterling in the UK, SEK3090 to 9660 in Scandinavia and $US35 000 to 800 000 in the US, depending on time delay in starting treatment after pain onset, size of infarct, thrombolytic agents used, study methodology, lists of clinical events considered in cost counting and the discount rate.  Thus, the results of the ETTT trial show that the used low dosages of alteplase administered intravenously over 3-7 days in heparinized patients cannot be recommended as a treatment for patients with deep venous thrombosis of lower limbs and/or pelvis.  Further studies are needed to define a more suitable dosage regimen of alteplase in this indication.  Streptokinase, urokinase and alteplase have all been shown to accelerate the lysis of pulmonary emboli and to decrease pulmonary vascular obstruction and pulmonary hypertension.   The local treatment of acute arterial occlusion in limb arteries results in rapid clearing of the artery in 67% of patients treated with streptokinase; the corresponding success rates for urokinase and alteplase are 81% and 88 to 94%, respectively.   More recently, new drugs like alteplase, reteplase, lanoteplase and saruplase have been a breakthrough in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction The non-antigenic competitor for these two compounds for the indication of MI is alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, rt-PA) The trials used to support Food and Drug Administration approval of alteplase for central venous catheter (CVC) occlusions generally had low pediatric enrollment; however, additional small studies are available that support use of alteplase for this indication in children Some acute ischemic strokes (before the 3rd hour) could be treated with alteplase if there is no absolute or relative contraindication for thrombolysis.  Alteplase and reteplase are the most efficient thrombolytics despite a higher risk of cerebral bleeding.

"[SOC]###context: ince then, additional checkpoint inhibitors, including avelumab, durvalumab, and nivolumab, have gained approval.   Avelumab, an anti-programmed death-ligand 1 monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma and platinum-treated urothelial carcinoma, was initially approved with a 10 mg/kg weight-based dose.   Five new PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC): pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, nivolumab, and avelumab.   We reviewed the literature for prospective studies evaluating PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in refractory urothelial carcinoma patients, which formed the basis for US Food and Drug Administration approval of 5 different antagonistic antibodies targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 (atezolizumab, durvalumab, avelumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab).  Nowadays, five immune checkpoint inhibitors blocking PD-1 (pembrolizumab, nivolumab) or PD-L1 (atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab) have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for the first- or second-line use in urothelial carcinoma, based on durable response and manageable safety profiles observed in relevant clinical trials.   RETATION: Avelumab showed antitumour activity in the treatment of patients with platinum-refractory metastatic urothelial carcinoma; a manageable safety profile was reported in all avelumab-treated patients.  These data provide the rationale for therapeutic use of avelumab in metastatic urothelial carcinoma and it has received accelerated US FDA approval in this setting on this basis. FUNDIN BACKGROUND: Anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)/programmed cell death 1 antibodies have shown clinical activity in platinum-treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma, resulting in regulatory approval of several agents, including avelumab (anti-PD-L1).  Avelumab as second-line therapy for metastatic, platinum-treated urothelial carcinoma in the phase Ib JAVELIN Solid Tumor study: 2-year updated efficacy and safety analysis.  BACKGROUND: Avelumab has recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the therapy of Merkel cell carcinoma and urothelial carcinoma.  SIONS: Maintenance avelumab plus best supportive care significantly prolonged overall survival, as compared with best supportive care alone, among patients with urothelial cancer who had disease that had not progressed with first-line chemotherapy.  (Fund By the emergence of modern immunotherapies with active agents like PD-1 (nivolumab, pembrolizumab) and PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockers (atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab), new therapeutic options have become available for the treatment of patients with locally advanced and metastatic urothelial carcinoma.

"[SOC]###context: Investigation of chromosome folding in mutants confirms roles for RSC, ""gene looping"" factor Ssu72, Mediator, H3K56 acetyltransferase Rtt109, and the N-terminal tail of H4 in folding of the yeast genome.  Furthermore, different regions of Pta1 interact with the CPF subunits Ssu72, Pti1, and Ysh1, supporting the idea that Pta1 acts as a scaffold to organize CPF.  The essential N terminus of the Pta1 scaffold protein is required for snoRNA transcription termination and Ssu72 function but is dispensable for pre-mRNA 3'-end processing The first 300 amino acids of Pta1 are sufficient for interactions with Ssu72, which is needed for pre-mRNA cleavage.   These findings suggest that the amino terminus of Pta1 has an inhibitory effect and that this effect can be neutralized through the interaction with Ssu72.  TFIIB crosslinks to both the promoter and terminator regions of the PMA1 and BLM10 genes, and its association with the terminator, but not the promoter, is adversely affected by E62K and by depletion of the Ssu72 component of the CPF 3' end processing complex, and is independent of TBP.   These interactions are transcription-dependent, require the Ssu72 and Pta1 components of the CPF 3'-end processing complex, and require the phosphatase activity of Ssu72.  We propose a model for RNAP II transcription in which promoter and terminator regions are juxtaposed, and that the resulting gene loops facilitate transcription reinitiation by the same molecule of RNAP II in a manner dependent upon Ssu72-mediated CTD dephosphorylation.  The essential N terminus of the Pta1 scaffold protein is required for snoRNA transcription termination and Ssu72 function but is dispensable for pre-mRNA 3'-end processing.  The pta1-Delta75 mutant is defective for snoRNA termination, RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain Ser5-P dephosphorylation, and gene looping but is fully functional for mRNA 3'-end processing.   We conclude that Swd2. 2 opposes condensin-mediated chromosome condensation by facilitating the function of the two CPF-associated phosphatases PP1 and Ssu72.  Based on the interactions of Ssu72 and Sub1 with both the Pta1 of CPF and the TFIIB component of the initiation complex, we present a model describing how these novel connections between the transcription and 3' end processing machineries might facilitate transitions in the RNAP II transcription cycle.  By the degron-mediated depletion of Pta1, we show that the removal of this essential region leads to a loss of Ssu72, yet surprisingly, in vitro cleavage and polyadenylation remain efficient.  The pta1-Delta75 mutant is defective for snoRNA termination, RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain Ser5-P dephosphorylation, and gene looping but is fully functional for mRNA 3'-end processing.

"[SOC]###context: Here, we examine the role of the related transcription factors Ecm22 and Upc2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentation.  The zinc cluster proteins Upc2 and Ecm22 promote filamentation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by sterol biosynthesis-dependent and -independent pathways.  Upc2, a zinc-cluster transcription factor, is a regulator of ergosterol biosynthesis in yeast.  The zinc cluster proteins Ecm22, Upc2, Sut1 and Sut2 have initially been identified as regulators of sterol import in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  Yeast studies defined a 7-bp consensus sterol-response element (SRE) common to genes involved in sterol biosynthesis and two transcription factors, Upc2 and Ecm22, which direct transcription of sterol biosynthetic genes.  Ecm22 and Upc2 positively control the expression of FHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes.  RNA-seq analysis shows that hypoxic regulation of sterol synthesis genes in Y.  lipolytica is predominantly mediated by Upc2.  However, in yeasts such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans sterol synthesis is instead regulated by Upc2, an unrelated transcription factor with a Gal4-type zinc finger.  Recombinant endogenous promoter studies show that the UPC2 anaerobic AR1b elements act in trans to regulate ergosterol gene expression.  One such factor could be the mammalian equivalent of the gene product of UPC2.  Simultaneous deletion of ECM22 and UPC2 as well as mutation of the three Ste12-binding sites in the PRM1 promoter completely abolishes basal and pheromone-induced PRM1 expression, indicating that Ste12 and Ecm22/Upc2 control PRM1 transcription through distinct pathways.  Ecm22 and Upc2 positively regulate basal expression of PRM1 and PRM4.  Our results indicate that Upc2 must occupy UPC2 AR1b elements in order for ERG gene expression induction to take place.  A yeast mutant (upc2-1) with a defect in the aerobic exclusion of sterols was found to have increased sensitivity to LiCl and NaCl.  The AR1b elements are absolutely required for auto-induction of UPC2 gene expression and protein and require Upc2 and Ecm22 for function.  Secretion of apoE was achieved only by the use of a mutant (upc2) strain of yeast with the phenotype of enhanced uptake and intracellular esterification of exogenous cholesterol.  Gas chromatographic analysis of the nonsaponifiable fractions of the various strains showed that the major sterol for all YLR228c and UPC2 combinations was ergosterol, the consensus yeast sterol. .  In the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans, the zinc cluster transcription factor Upc2p has been shown to regulate the expression of ERG11 and other genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis upon exposure to azole antifungals.  By comparing the gene expression profiles of the fluconazole-resistant isolate and of strains carrying wild-type and mutated UPC2 alleles, we identified target genes that are controlled by Upc2p.

Herein, we generated a first-in-class humanized antibody (PRL3-zumab) against PRL-3, an intracellular tumor-associated phosphatase upregulated in multiple human cancers, for unconventional cancer immunotherapies.  We focused on gastric cancer (GC), wherein elevated PRL-3 mRNA levels significantly correlated with shortened overall survival of GC patients.   Using human GC cell lines, we demonstrated that PRL3-zumab specifically blocked PRL-3+, but not PRL-3-, orthotopic gastric tumors.  In this setting, PRL3-zumab had better therapeutic efficacy as a monotherapy, rather than simultaneous combination with 5-fluorouracil or 5-fluorouracil alone.

"[SOC]###context: Among the proteins involved in the sumoylation pathway, Ubc9 is the sole E2-conjugating enzyme required for sumoylation and plays a central role by interacting with almost all of the partners required for sumoylation.   We also found a marked rise in levels of Ubc9, the only SUMO conjugation enzyme identified so far.   Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 (Ubc9), the sole conjugating enzyme for sumoylation, regulates protein function and plays an important role in sumoylation-mediated cellular pathways.  We observed steady-state expression of SUMO1-3, SUMO-conjugated enzyme-UBC9 and deSUMOylating enzymes - SENPs, throughout normal gestation.   The small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) pathway in eukaryotes is an essential post-translational modification required for a variety of cellular processes, development and organelle biogenesis.  SUMO-conjugating enzyme (Ubc9) is an important conjunction enzyme in the SUMO pathway.   Western blot analysis, EMSA, ELISA, confocal microscopy and immunoprecipitation demonstrated that drastic tissue hypoxia, elevated levels of proteins conjugated by small ubiquitin-related modifier-1 (SUMO-1), Ubc9 (the only known conjugating enzyme for the sumoylation pathway) or HIF-1α, augmented sumoylation of HIF-1α, nucleus-bound translocation and enhanced transcriptional activity of HIF-1α in RVLM neurons took place preferentially during the pro-life phase of experimental brain death.   Among the proteins involved in the sumoylation pathway, Ubc9 is the sole E2-conjugating enzyme required for sumoylation and plays a central role by interacting with almost all of the partners required for sumoylation.  UBC9 is the only E2 conjugating enzyme involved in this process, and loss of UBC9 completely abolishes the SUMOylation pathway.  Here we have identified host cell proteins involved with the cellular SUMOylation pathway, SUMO-1 (small ubiquitin-like modifier) and UBC9, a SUMO-1 conjugating enzyme that interact with classical swine fever virus (CSFV) Core protein.  Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 (Ubc9), the sole conjugating enzyme for sumoylation, regulates protein function and plays an important role in sumoylation-mediated cellular pathways.  In this study, we found that the SUMOylation pathway was involved in the DENV life cycle, since DENV replication was reduced by silencing the cellular gene Ubc9, which encodes the sole E2-conjugating enzyme required for SUMOylation.  Here we demonstrate that the synaptic diffusion of Ubc9, the sole conjugating enzyme of the sumoylation pathway, is regulated by synaptic activity.  The SUMO pathway parallels the classical ubiquitinylation pathway with three discrete steps: activation involving the enzyme E1, conjugation involving the E2 enzyme UBC9, and substrate modification through the cooperative association of UBC9 and E3 ligases.  RAP80 interacts with the SUMO-conjugating enzyme UBC9 and is a novel target for sumoylation.  Among the proteins involved in the sumoylation pathway, Ubc9 is the sole E2-conjugating enzyme required for sumoylation and plays a central role by interacting with almost all of the partners required for sumoylation.  Although there are multiple E2 enzymes required for ubiquitination, there is only one E2-conjugating enzyme for sumoylation, which is Ubc9.  Consistent with a role of sumoylation in inhibiting Tec1 activity, specifically increasing sumoylation of Tec1 by fusing it to the sumoylating enzyme Ubc9 leads to a dramatic decrease of Tec1 transcriptional activity.  Ubc9 is an E2-conjugating enzyme required for sumoylation and has been implicated in regulating several critical cellular pathways.  We also exposed placental explants to hypoxia to study the effect on the SUMOylation pathway. We observed steady-state expression of SUMO1-3, SUMO-conjugated enzyme-UBC9 and deSUMOylating enzymes - SENPs, throughout normal gestation It has been reported that ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 (Ubc9), the unique enzyme2 in the sumoylation pathway, is up-regulated in many cancers Among the proteins involved in the sumoylation pathway, Ubc9 is the sole E2-conjugating enzyme required for sumoylation and plays a central role by interacting with almost all of the partners required for sumoylation Here we demonstrate that the synaptic diffusion of Ubc9, the sole conjugating enzyme of the sumoylation pathway, is regulated by synaptic activity Here, we investigated inhibition of sumoylation as a novel antifibrotic approach. Sumoylation was inhibited by siRNA-mediated knockdown of the Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifiers (SUMO) E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc9, which is essential for sumoylation Here we have identified host cell proteins involved with the cellular SUMOylation pathway, SUMO-1 (small ubiquitin-like modifier) and UBC9, a SUMO-1 conjugating enzyme that interact with classical swine fever virus (CSFV) Core protein A new pathway that contributes to mutant CFTR degradation is mediated by the small heat shock protein, Hsp27, which cooperates with Ubc9, the E2 enzyme for SUMOylation, to selectively conjugate mutant CFTR with SUMO-2/3 Using transfection of Ets-1 wildtype (WT) or its sumoylation deficient version (Ets-1 K15R/K227R), as well as WT or mutant proteins of the SUMO pathway, we further demonstrated that the E2 SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and a E3 SUMO ligase, PIASy, can enhance Ets-1 sumoylation, while a SUMO protease, SENP1, can desumoylate Ets-1 The results show that basal SUMO modification is required for stimuli-induced p100 phosphorylation and that blocking SUMOylation of p100, either by site-directed mutation or by short interfering RNA-targeted diminution of E2 SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9, inhibits various physiological stimuli-induced p100 processing and ultimate activation of the alternative NF-kappaB pathway Sumoylation proceeds via an enzymatic pathway that is mechanistically analogous to ubiquitination, but requires a different E1-activating enzyme and Ubc9, a SUMO-specific E2-conjugating enzyme SUMO-conjugating enzyme E2 UBC9 mediates viral immediate-early protein SUMOylation in crayfish to facilitate reproduction of white spot syndrome virus.  OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 (UBC9), a small ubiquitin-like modifier-conjugating enzyme, in cardiomyocyte protein quality control.   Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme             9 (Ubc9), the sole conjugating enzyme for sumoylation, regulates protein function             and plays a key role in tumorigenesis.   UBC9 is the only E2 conjugating enzyme involved in this process, and loss of UBC9 completely abolishes the SUMOylation pathway.  Here we demonstrate that the synaptic diffusion of Ubc9, the sole conjugating enzyme of the sumoylation pathway, is regulated by synaptic activity.  Sumoylation proceeds via an enzymatic pathway that is mechanistically analogous to ubiquitination, but requires a different E1-activating enzyme and Ubc9, a SUMO-specific E2-conjugating enzyme.  Western blot analysis, EMSA, ELISA, confocal microscopy and immunoprecipitation demonstrated that drastic tissue hypoxia, elevated levels of proteins conjugated by small ubiquitin-related modifier-1 (SUMO-1), Ubc9 (the only known conjugating enzyme for the sumoylation pathway) or HIF-1α, augmented sumoylation of HIF-1α, nucleus-bound translocation and enhanced transcriptional activity of HIF-1α in RVLM neurons took place preferentially during the pro-life phase of experimental brain death.  In this study, we found that the SUMOylation pathway was involved in the DENV life cycle, since DENV replication was reduced by silencing the cellular gene Ubc9, which encodes the sole E2-conjugating enzyme required for SUMOylation.  In this study, we revisited the role of Tax SUMOylation using a strategy based on the targeting of Ubc9, the unique E2 SUMO-conjugating enzyme.  Taken together, these findings provide evidence for regulated sumoylation as a mechanism to modulate the activity of Tec1 and validate Ubc9 fusion-directed sumoylation as a useful approach for studying protein sumoylation.  We report that the high risk HPVE6 proteins reduce the intracellular quantity of the sole SUMO conjugation enzyme, Ubc9, concomitant with decreased host sumoylation.  We observed steady-state expression of SUMO1-3, SUMO-conjugated enzyme-UBC9 and deSUMOylating enzymes - SENPs, throughout normal gestation.  As the sole E2 enzyme for SUMOylation, Ubc9 is predominantly nuclear.  Expression of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) molecules, SUMO E1 activating enzymes SAE1 and SAE2, SUMO E2 conjugating enzyme UBC9, and de-sumoylation enzyme sentrin/SUMO-specific proteases (SENP)1 was immunolocalized in rat intervertebral disc (IVD) cells.

Sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA2a), the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump, was found to be a key factor in the alteration of calcium cycling.  The calcium pump SERCA2a (sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2a), which plays a central role in cardiac contraction, shows decreased expression in heart failure (HF).

"[SOC]###context: A Phase 2 Study of Concurrent Radiation Therapy, Temozolomide, and the Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor Valproic Acid for Patients With Glioblastoma.  PURPOSE: Valproic acid (VPA) is an antiepileptic agent with histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) activity shown to sensitize glioblastoma (GBM) cells to radiation in preclinical models.   Median overall survival (OS) was 29. 6 months (range: 21-63. 8 months), and median progression-free survival (PFS) was 10. 5 months (range: 6. 8-51. 2 months).  OS at 6, 12, and 24 months was 97%, 86%, and 56%, respectively.  PFS at 6, 12, and 24 months was 70%, 43%, and 38% respectively.   CONCLUSIONS: Addition of VPA to concurrent RT/TMZ in patients with newly diagnosed GBM was well tolerated.  Additionally, VPA may result in improved outcomes compared to historical data and merits further study.  Treatment of GDSCs with histone deacetylase inhibitors, TSA and VPA, significantly reduced proliferation rates of the cells and expression of the stem cell markers, indicating differentiation of the cells.  Since differentiation into GBM makes them susceptible to the conventional cancer treatments, we posit that use of histone deacetylase inhibitors may increase efficacy of the conventional cancer treatments for eliminating GDSCs.  Several clinical studies have reported that valproic acid could prolong survival of GBM patients.   Our meta-analysis confirmed the benefit of using VPA (HR, 0. 56; 95% CI, 0. 44-0. 71).  Sub-group analysis shows that patients treated with VPA had a hazard ratio of 0. 74 with a 95% confidence interval of 0. 59-0. 94 vs.  patients treated by other-AEDs and a hazard ratio of 0. 66 with a 95% confidence interval of 0. 52-0. 84 vs.  patients treated by administration of non-AEDs.   . CONCLUSION: The results of our study suggest that glioblastoma patients may experience prolonged survival due to VPA administration.   A new and exciting insight is the potential contribution of VPA to prolonged survival, particularly in glioblastomas.   Valproic acid (VPA) is an antiepileptic agent with histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) activity shown to sensitize glioblastoma (GBM) cells to radiation in preclinical models Valproic acid use during radiation therapy for glioblastoma associated with improved survival Valproic acid (VA) is an antiepileptic drug (AED) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor taken by patients with glioblastoma (GB) to manage seizures, and it can modulate the biologic effects of radiation therapy (RT) Valproic acid use during radiation therapy for glioblastoma associated with improved survival.  Prolonged survival with valproic acid use in the EORTC/NCIC temozolomide trial for glioblastoma.  PURPOSE: Valproic acid (VA) is an antiepileptic drug (AED) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor taken by patients with glioblastoma (GB) to manage seizures, and it can modulate the biologic effects of radiation therapy (RT).  We investigated whether VA use during RT for GB was associated with overall survival (OS). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Medical records of 544 adults with GB were retrospectively reviewed.  Analyses were performed to determine the association of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group recursive partitioning analysis (RTOG RPA) class, seizure history, and concurrent temozolomide (TMZ) and AED use during RT with OS. RESULTS: Seizures before the end of RT were noted in 217 (40%) patients, and 403 (74%) were taking an AED during RT; 29 (7%) were taking VA.   When the analysis was restricted to patients who received concurrent TMZ, VA use was marginally associated with OS (P=. 057; HR, 0. 54; 95% CI, -0. 09 to 1. 17), independently of RTOG RPA class and seizure history.  Patients using VPA in combination with temozolomide showed a longer median survival of 69 weeks (95% confidence interval [CI]: 61. 7-67. 3) compared with 61 weeks (95% CI: 52. 5-69. 5) in the group without VPA (hazard ratio, 0. 63; 95% CI: 0. 43-0. 92; P = . 016), adjusting for age, extent of resection, and O(6)-DNA methylguanine-methyltransferase promoter methylation status.  Use of VPA together with chemoradiation with temozolomide results in a 2-months' longer survival of patients with GBM.

"[SOC]###context: Standard treatment of transplant-eligible patients with relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) consists of rituximab and platinum-based chemotherapy, either ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (ICE) or dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin (DHAP), with autologous transplant consolidation for those with chemosensitive disease.  The intergroup Collaborative Trial in Relapsed Aggressive Lymphoma (CORAL) set the limits for this standard of treatment after first comparing 2 salvage regimens: rituximab, ifosfamide, etoposide, and carboplatin (R-ICE) and rituximab, dexamethasone, aracytine, and cisplatin (R-DHAP).   The response rate (RR) to first salvage chemotherapy was 23% (RR by regimen: dexamethasone, cytosine arabinoside and cisplatin [DHAP] 15%, etoposide, Solu-Medrol, cytosine arabinoside and cisplatin [ESHAP] 36%, and gemcitabine, dexamethasone and cisplatin [GDP] 45%); 25% (n = 28) of patients underwent ASCT.   PURPOSE: To evaluate the prognostic value of the cell of origin (COO) in patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBLC), prospectively treated by rituximab, dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin (R-DHAP) versus rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide and followed by intensive therapy plus autologous stem-cell transplantation on the Collaborative Trial in Relapsed Aggressive Lymphoma (CORAL) trial.   The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of two chemotherapy regimens based on platinum and cytarabine in association with etoposide and methylprednisolone (ESHAP) or with dexamethasone (DHAP) with or without Rituximab (± R) in patients with refractory or a relapsed Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL).   R-DHAP combines rituximab with cisplatin, cytarabine, and dexamethasone.   PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with CD20(+) DLBCL in first relapse or who were refractory after first-line therapy were randomly assigned to either rituximab, ifosfamide, etoposide, and carboplatin (R-ICE) or rituximab, dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin (R-DHAP).  Because of the inability to safely administer unattenuated doses of anthracycline-based regimens, dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin (DHAP) was used at full doses (along with rituximab for the DLBCL patient) until hepatic function normalized (1-5 cycles).   Randomized to DHAP (cisplatin-cytarabine-dexamethasone)-VIM (etoposide-ifosfamide-methotrexate)-DHAP (cisplatin-cytarabine-dexamethasone) chemotherapy with rituximab (R; R-DHAP arm) were 119 patients (113 evaluable) and to chemotherapy without rituximab (DHAP arm) 120 patients (112 evaluable).   Patients are first randomised between ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide) and DHAP (dexamethasone, ara-C and cisplatin), both combined with rituximab (R-ICE or R-DHAP).  BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The treatment of the patients with relapsed and refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma(NHL) remains difficult.  It was reported that DHAP regimen(cisplatin + Ara-C + dexamthsone) was an effective salvage therapy, but there was no report about it in China.

"[SOC]###context: CircRNAs are novel members of the non-coding RNA family.  For several decades circRNAs have been known to exist, however only recently the widespread abundance has become appreciated.  Annotation of circRNAs depends on sequencing reads spanning the backsplice junction and therefore map as non-linear reads in the genome.  Several pipelines have been developed to specifically identify these non-linear reads and consequently predict the landscape of circRNAs based on deep sequencing datasets.  Here, we use common RNAseq datasets to scrutinize and compare the output from five different algorithms; circRNA_finder, find_circ, CIRCexplorer, CIRI, and MapSplice and evaluate the levels of bona fide and false positive circRNAs based on RNase R resistance.

"[SOC]###context: We analyzed the mRNA levels of catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes: tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD), dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DBH) and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) in adrenal glands of 18 pigs with chronic systolic non-ischaemic HF (tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy due to right ventricle pacing) and 6 sham-operated controls.  This study aimed to investigate physical exercise-related changes in gene expression of catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes (tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine-ß-hydroxylase and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding (CREB) in the adrenal medulla, concentrations of catecholamines and corticosterone (CORT) in the plasma and the weight of adrenal glands of chronically psychosocially stressed adult rats exposed daily to 20 min treadmill running for 12 weeks.   In the adrenal medulla, despite the absence of morphological changes, immunohistochemistry for tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine β-hydroxylase and phenyl-ethanolamine-N-methyltransferase demonstrated an increased immunopositivity for these cathecolamine-synthesizing enzymes after intense exercise.   Using isolated adrenal medulla we observed no difference in basal catecholamine secretion percentile between obese and lean animals.  However, the percentile of catecholamine secretion stimulated by high K+ concentration was lower in the obese group.  There was a decrease in the tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme expression (57. 3%, P<0. 004) in adrenal glands of obese mice.  Interestingly, the expression of dopamine beta-hydroxylase was also reduced (47. 0%, P<0. 005).  Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase expression was not affected.   Differential housing (single vs.  group) and social defeat of rats is known to alter the activity of catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes in the medulla.  The present studies examined the effect of 70 days of triad (3 rats per large cage) and individual housing of male rats on adrenal mRNA levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) and phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and on TH protein levels.  As a first step toward understanding the molecular mechanisms by which catecholamine synthesis is controlled in the tumor, we measured the levels of mRNA coding for the catecholamine synthesizing enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and catecholamines in 6 pheochromocytomas and 2 normal adrenal glands.   We also examined the gene expression of the messengers of other catecholamine synthesizing enzymes, dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) and aromatic 1-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) in pheochromocytomas.   These findings indicate that catecholamine overproduction in pheochromocytomas is mediated by the overexpression of genes coding for catecholamines synthesizing enzymes, TH, DBH, and AADC.  he present study investigated the cellular localization of 3 catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH), and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT)  tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) the rate limiting catecholamine biosynthetic enzyme and also of dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) and phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PNMT) in sympathetic ganglia and adrenals This study aimed to investigate physical exercise-related changes in gene expression of catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes (tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine-ß-hydroxylase and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding (CREB) in the adrenal medulla, concentrations of catecholamines and corticosterone (CORT) in the plasma and the weight of adrenal glands of chronically psychosocially stressed adult rats exposed daily to 20 min treadmill running for 12 weeks As a first step toward understanding the molecular mechanisms by which catecholamine synthesis is controlled in the tumor, we measured the levels of mRNA coding for the catecholamine synthesizing enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and catecholamines in 6 pheochromocytomas and 2 normal adrenal glands We analyzed the mRNA levels of catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes: tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD), dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DBH) and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) in adrenal glands of 18 pigs with chronic systolic non-ischaemic HF (tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy due to right ventricle pacing) and 6 sham-operated controls This study aimed to investigate physical exercise-related changes in gene expression of catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes (tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine-ß-hydroxylase and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding (CREB) in the adrenal medulla, concentrations of catecholamines and corticosterone (CORT) in the plasma and the weight of adrenal glands of chronically psychosocially stressed adult rats exposed daily to 20 min treadmill running for 12 weeks.  We used immunocytochemistry to study the ontogeny of leu-enkephalin and the catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes dopamine beta-hydroxylase and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase in adjacent sections of 14 fetal rhesus and 31 fetal human adrenal glands.

As CHEK2 is a cell-cycle master controller, we tested the hypothesis that heterozygosity for the frameshift alteration CHEK2*1100delC is associated with increased risk of malignant melanoma.  In the current study, we evaluated the possible associations of seven common variants of the DNA repair and cell cycle control genes BRCA2 and CHEK2 with malignant melanoma (MM).  Promotor methylation analysis of key regulatory genes involved in cell cycle control (p14, p15, p16, CHK2), DNA repair (hMLH1), apoptosis (p73, survivin, DAPK), and differentiation (RARb, WT1) was performed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction.  CHEK2 is a key cell cycle control gene encoding a pluripotent kinase that can cause arrest or apoptosis in response to unrepaired DNA damage.  High-fidelity maintenance of genomic integrity in eukaryotes is ensured by cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair.  The checkpoint kinase, Chk2, has been implicated in both of these responses.  In response to DNA damage, Chk2 is initially phosphorylated at Thr-68, which leads to its full activation.  The fully activated Chk2 then phosphorylates downstream substrates of cell cycle control.  Checkpoint kinase 2 (hCHK2/hCds1) is a tumor suppressor gene involved in cell-cycle control.

"[SOC]###context: OBJECTIVES: In a post-hoc analysis, we aimed to validate the Lupus Low Disease Activity State (LLDAS) definition as an endpoint in an systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) Phase IIb randomised controlled trial (RCT) (MUSE [NCT01438489]) and then utilize LLDAS to discriminate between anifrolumab and placebo CONCLUSIONS: LLDAS attainment represents a clinically meaningful SLE outcome measure, and anifrolumab is associated with more patients who met LLDAS criteria versus placebo.   A post-hoc analysis of pooled data from two Phase IIb trials (sifalimumab; NCT01283139, anifrolumab; NCT01438489) assessed the clinical significance of a Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Responder Index (SRI(4)) response (Week 52) for 736 patients with moderate to severe SLE disease activity (study entry).   Objectives: To compare the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and tolerability of subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous anifrolumab, an anti-type I interferon receptor monoclonal antibody in development for SLE, in healthy volunteers.  Characterisation of anifrolumab, a fully human anti-interferon receptor antagonist antibody for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus.  Objective: We investigated the mechanistic and pharmacological properties of anifrolumab, a fully human, effector-null, anti-type I interferon (IFN) alpha receptor 1 (IFNAR1) monoclonal antibody in development for SLE.  Conclusions: Anifrolumab potently inhibits type I IFN-dependent signalling, including the type I IFN autoamplification loop, and is a promising therapeutic for patients with SLE and other diseases that exhibit chronic dysfunctional type I IFN signalling.  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with a polymorphic presentation.  The variability in the clinical expression and severity of SLE makes new treatments both essential and challenging to develop.  Several biotherapies targeting different pathophysiological pathways have been developed over the past 15 years.  The results of Phase II trials were encouraging but rarely borne out by Phase III trials.  Recent data, which are discussed in detail in this review, allowed belimumab - a monoclonal antibody against BLyS (B-lymphocyte stimulator) - to become the first biotherapy approved for use in SLE.  Other molecules targeting B cells include the two anti-BLyS antibodies tabalumab and blisibimod; atacicept, which targets both BLyS and APRIL (a proliferation-inducing ligand); and the monoclonal antibody to CD22 epratuzumab.  The rekindling of interest in the B-cell pathway has also driven new clinical research into rituximab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD20 with evaluations of new strategies.  A new and promising approach is the use of inhibitors of the type 1 interferon (IFN) pathway, of which the most promising is anifrolumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the type 1 IFN receptor.  OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of anifrolumab, a type I interferon (IFN) receptor antagonist, in a phase IIb, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of adults with moderate-to-severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

"[SOC]###context: While SAMe is a methyl donor, MTA is an inhibitor of methylation.  SAMe can convert to MTA spontaneously, so the effect of exogenous SAMe may be mediated by MTA.  Based on known SET domain structures, the mutations likely affect either the lysine-substrate binding pocket, the binding site for the adenosylmethionine methyl donor, or a critical tyrosine predicted to interact with the substrate lysine epsilon-amino group Also, S-adenosylhomocysteine or methyl donor deficiency inhibits RIZ1 and other H3 lysine 9 methylation activities.  Angiosperms synthesize S-methylmethionine (SMM) from methionine (Met) and S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) in a unique reaction catalyzed by Met S-methyltransferase (MMT).  SMM serves as methyl donor for Met synthesis from homocysteine, catalyzed by homocysteine S-methyltransferase (HMT).  Plants synthesize S-methylmethionine (SMM) from S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), and methionine (Met) by a unique reaction and, like other organisms, use SMM as a methyl donor for Met synthesis from homocysteine (Hcy).  AtHMT-1 and -2 both utilize l-SMM or (S,S)-AdoMet as a methyl donor in vitro and have higher affinities for SMM.  When the serine residue is mutated to glutamic acid, which mimics the phosphorylated serine residue, the mutant CARM1 exhibits diminished ability to bind the methyl donor adenosylmethionine and diminished histone methylation activity.  S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), the major methyl donor for DNA and histone methylation was fed with ethanol for 1month in order to modify the effects of ethanol on rat liver.  To investigate if tumor growth is dependent on the enzymatic activity of Ezh2, we developed a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor, EI1, which inhibits the enzymatic activity of Ezh2 through direct binding to the enzyme and competing with the methyl group donor S-Adenosyl methionine.  The enzyme was capable of transferring methyl groups to selected lysine residues in a substrate protein using S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) as the methyl donor.  SAM is the main methyl group donor for methyltransferases to modify DNA, RNA, protein, metabolites, or phospholipid target substrates.  To control the enzymatic activity of vSET in vivo with an engineered S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) analogue as methyl donor cofactor, we have carried out structure-guided design, synthesis, and characterization of orthogonal vSET methyltransferase mutant/SAM analogue pairs using a ""bump-and-hole"" strategy.  Protein lysine methyltransferases are important regulators of epigenetic signaling.  One of the well-studied PTMs, arginine methylation, is catalyzed by protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) with SAM as the methyl donor.  While SAMe is a methyl donor, MTA is an inhibitor of methylation.  The purified cytochrome can act as a methyl acceptor for a methyltransferase activity in the cell extract that uses S-adenosylmethionine as methyl donor.  This enzyme utilizes S-adenosyl-L-methionine as the methyl donor.

"[SOC]###context: The aCNEs are rich in tissue-specific enhancers Transgenic zebrafish assay of some human CNE enhancers that have been lost in teleosts Conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) in vertebrate genomes often act as developmental enhancers, In all four cases where the zebra fish and human CNE display a similar expression pattern in zebra fish, the human CNE also displays a similar expression pattern in mouse.  This suggests that the endogenous enhancer activity of ∼30% of human CNEs can be determined from experiments in zebra fish If these ancient CNEs are indeed enhancers directing tissue-specific expression of Hox genes, divergence of their sequences in vertebrate lineages might have led to altered expression patterns and presumably the functions of their associated Hox genes.  Comparisons of noncoding sequences of the elephant shark and human Hox clusters have identified a large number of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs), which represent putative cis-regulatory elements that may be involved in the regulation of Hox genes.  Animal genomes possess highly conserved cis-regulatory sequences that are often found near genes that regulate transcription and development.  We test 42 of our PCNEs in transgenic zebrafish assays--including examples from vertebrates and amphioxus--and find that the majority are functional enhancers.  The genomes of vertebrates, flies, and nematodes contain highly conserved noncoding elements (CNEs).  CNEs cluster around genes that regulate development, and where tested, they can act as transcriptional enhancers.  , we identified 17 highly conserved noncoding elements, 9 of which revealed specific acetylation marks in chromatin-immunoprecipitation and microarray (ChIP-chip) assays performed across 250 kb of the Lmo2 locus in 11 cell types covering different stages of hematopoietic differentiation.  All candidate regulatory regions were tested in transgenic mice.  An extended LMO2 proximal promoter fragment displayed strong endothelial activity, while the distal promoter showed weak forebrain activity.  Eight of the 15 distal candidate elements functioned as enhancers, Pan-vertebrate developmental cis-regulatory elements are discernible as highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) and are often dispersed over large areas around the pleiotropic genes whose expression they control.  HCNEs of both human and zebrafish function as specific developmental enhancers in zebrafish.  several transcriptional enhancers are conserved between amphioxus and vertebrates--a very wide phylogenetic distance.  We recently described GRBs in vertebrates, where most HCNEs function as enhancers Besides developmental regulators that are likely targets of HCNE enhancers We identify and characterize highly conserved noncoding elements flanking the TNF gene, which undergo activation-dependent intrachromosomal interactions.  These elements, hypersensitive site (HSS)-9 and HSS+3 (9 kb upstream and 3 kb downstream of the TNF gene, respectively), contain DNase I hypersensitive sites in naive, T helper 1, and T helper 2 primary T cells.  Both HSS-9 and HSS+3 inducibly associate with acetylated histones, indicative of chromatin remodeling, bind the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)p in vitro and in vivo, and function as enhancers We used the sequence signatures identified by this approach to successfully assign tissue-specific predictions to approximately 328,000 human-mouse conserved noncoding elements in the human genome.  By overlapping these genome-wide predictions with a data set of enhancers validated in vivo, in transgenic mice, we were able to confirm our results with a 28% sensitivity and 50% precision.  Fish-mammal genomic comparisons have proved powerful in identifying conserved noncoding elements likely to be cis-regulatory in nature, and the majority of those tested in vivo have been shown to act as tissue-specific enhancers associated with genes involved in transcriptional regulation of development.  uncovered two anciently conserved noncoding sequences (CNS) upstream of COUP-TFII (CNS-62kb and CNS-66kb).  Testing these two elements using reporter constructs in liver cells (HepG2) revealed that CNS-66kb, but not CNS-62kb, yielded robust in vitro enhancer activity.

Our findings suggest that the association of alpha-NAGA with its substrates is strongly affected by the amino acid substitution at R329 and that the association with GalNAcalpha1-O-Thr is more highly susceptible to structural changes.  The residual mutant enzyme in R329W could not associate with GalNAcalpha1-O-Thr and GalNAcalpha1-O-Ser.  However, the residual mutant enzyme in R329Q catalyzed GalNAcalpha1-O-Ser to some extent.  Therefore, the urinary ratio of GalNAcalpha1-O-Ser:GalNAcalpha1-O-Thr was lower and the clinical phenotype was milder in the R329Q mutation.

"[SOC]###context: Recent functional studies have demonstrated that many microRNAs (miRNAs) are expressed by RNA polymerase II in a specific spatiotemporal manner during the development of organisms and play a key role in cell-lineage decisions and morphogenesis.  They are therefore functionally related to a number of key protein coding developmental genes, that form genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) with arrays of highly conserved non-coding elements (HCNEs) functioning as long-range enhancers that collaboratively regulate the expression of their target genes Genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) are chromosomal regions spanned by highly conserved non-coding elements (HCNEs), most of which serve as regulatory inputs of one target gene in the region.  The target genes are most often transcription factors involved in embryonic development and differentiation.  GRBs often contain extensive gene deserts, as well as additional 'bystander' genes intertwined with HCNEs but whose expression and function are unrelated to those of the target gene.  We show evidence that GRB target genes have properties that set them apart from their bystanders as well as other genes in the genome: longer CpG islands, a higher number and wider spacing of alternative transcription start sites, and a distinct composition of transcription factor binding sites in their core/proximal promoters.  Target gene expression correlates with the acetylation state of HCNEs in the region GRB targets are genes with a number of unique features that are the likely cause of their ability to respond to regulatory inputs from very long distances.  Insect genomes contain larger blocks of conserved gene order (microsynteny) than would be expected under a random breakage model of chromosome evolution.  We present evidence that microsynteny has been retained to keep large arrays of highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) intact.  These arrays span key developmental regulatory genes, forming genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs).  We recently described GRBs in vertebrates, where most HCNEs function as enhancers and HCNE arrays specify complex expression programs of their target genes.  We found the largest mammal-teleost conserved chromosomal segments to be spanned by highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs), their developmental regulatory target genes, and phylogenetically and functionally unrelated ""bystander"" genes.  Bystander genes are not specifically under the control of the regulatory elements that drive the target genes and are expressed in patterns that are different from those of the target genes Genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) are chromosomal regions spanned by highly conserved non-coding elements (HCNEs), most of which serve as regulatory inputs of one target gene in the region.

"[SOC]###context: STUDY OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate whether adding the item of ""apple body type"" to the STOP-BANG questionnaire enhances diagnostic performance of the questionnaire for detecting obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).  CONCLUSION: In the sleep center setting, adding the body type item to the STOP-BANG questionnaire improves not only clinical prediction for PSG confirmed OSA but also predicts moderate to severe of OSA.   High and low probability of OSA were defined as a STOP-Bang score of ≥5 (h-OSA) and of<5 (l-OSA), respectively.  The STOP-BANG questionnaire improves the detection of epilepsy patients at risk for obstructive sleep apnea.  We performed a quality improvement project, evaluating for improvements in the screening of OSA in epilepsy patients using the STOP-BANG questionnaire.   Diagnostic accuracy of the Berlin questionnaire, STOP-BANG, STOP, and Epworth sleepiness scale in detecting obstructive sleep apnea: A bivariate meta-analysis.  Although screening tools such as the Berlin questionnaire (BQ), STOP-BANG questionnaire (SBQ), STOP questionnaire (STOP), and Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) are widely used for OSA, the findings regarding their diagnostic accuracy are controversial.   Compared with the BQ, STOP, and ESS, the SBQ is a more accurate tool for detecting mild, moderate, and severe OSA.  Sleep specialists should use the SBQ to conduct patient interviews for the early diagnosis of OSA in clinical settings, particularly in resource-poor countries and sleep clinics where PSG is unavailable.  Modified Mallampati Score Improves Specificity of STOP-BANG Questionnaire for Obstructive Sleep Apnea.  BACKGROUND: An accurate, clinical screening tool for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) that identifies patients for further diagnostic testing would assist in the diagnosis of this comorbidity.  One example, the STOP-BANG questionnaire (SBQ), has been validated as a screening tool with high sensitivity.  The validated Berlin, STOP-BANG, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale questionnaires were administered to all eligible subjects to assess SA risk and daytime somnolence, and their demographic and clinical information, health-related quality of life, and symptoms of depression were collected using the questionnaires.  Ninety-nine (49. 5%) subjects were identified as high risk for SA using the Berlin questionnaire, whereas 26 (13%), 137 (68. 5%), and 37 (18. 5%) subjects were classified as low, intermediate, and high risk for SA, respectively, using the STOP-BANG questionnaire.   CONCLUSIONS: The SACS and the STOP-Bang questionnaires (BMI threshold of 25 kg/m2) were found to provide the best positive and negative LRs, respectively, for the prediction of OSA.  The aims of this study were to (1) explore the incidence of right-sided heart dysfunction (RHD) and STOP-Bang questionnaire responses consistent with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and (2) assess the relationship between patients with STOP-Bang questionnaire responses consistent with OSA and echocardiographic findings suggestive of RHD.  This study aims: (1) to identify patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who are at high risk for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by utilizing the STOP-BANG questionnaire and (2) to evaluate the relationship between OSA risk as determined by the STOP-BANG questionnaire and self-reported sleepiness and fatigue using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), respectively.  Validation of the STOP-Bang Questionnaire as a Screening Tool for Obstructive Sleep Apnea among Different Populations: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.  Validation of a Portuguese version of the STOP-Bang questionnaire as a screening tool for obstructive sleep apnea: Analysis in a sleep clinic.  This meta-analysis confirms the high performance of the STOP-Bang questionnaire in the sleep clinic and surgical population for screening of OSA.  <b>PURPOSE OF REVIEW</b>: The present review aims to provide an update on the various practical applications of the STOP-Bang questionnaire in anesthesia, surgery, and perioperative medicine. <br><b>RECENT FINDINGS</b>: The STOP-Bang questionnaire was originally validated as a screening tool to identify surgical patients who are at high-risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).  Patients with a STOP-Bang score of 0--2 can be classified as low-risk for moderate-to-severe OSA.  Further, patients with a STOP-Bang score at least 3 can be classified as high risk for moderate-to-severe OSA if the serum HCO3 at least 28 mmol/l.  STOP-Bang can be used as a novel tool for perioperative risk stratification because it easily identifies patients who are at increased risk of perioperative complications. <br><b>SUMMARY</b>: STOP-Bang at least 3 was recommended previously to identify the suspected or undiagnosed OSA.  Because of its practical application, STOP-Bang is a useful screening tool for patients with suspected or undiagnosed OSA. <br> The STOP-BANG questionnaire has been used to identify surgical patients at risk for undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by classifying patients as low risk (LR) if STOP-BANG score < 3 or high risk (HR) if STOP-BANG score ≥ 3.  Among the questionnaires that are commonly used for obstructive sleep apnoea screening, it remains unclear whether the STOP-BANG or Berlin Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome questionnaire is more effective in terms of ease of use, usage period and diagnosis of surgical patients with obstructive sleep apnoea risk.  Evaluation of the Arabic version of STOP-Bang questionnaire as a screening tool for obstructive sleep apnea.  The STOP-BANG questionnaire offers clinicians an efficient and objective tool for improving detection of OSA risk in MS patients.  Alternative scoring models of STOP-bang questionnaire improve specificity to detect undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea.  The Arabic version of STOP-Bang questionnaire is an easy-to-use tool that can be implemented as a reliable, quick screening tool for OSA in patients referred to sleep clinic.  This study aims: (1) to identify patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who are at high risk for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by utilizing the STOP-BANG questionnaire and (2) to evaluate the relationship between OSA risk as determined by the STOP-BANG questionnaire and self-reported sleepiness and fatigue using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), respectively.  This study aimed to compare the efficiency of the STOP-BANG and Berlin Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome questionnaires for evaluating potential respiratory complications during the perioperative period.  OBJECTIVE The STOP-Bang questionnaire was developed as a quick and simple screening tool for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in preoperative clinics.  This study aimed to evaluate and validate the Arabic version of Stop-Bang questionnaire as a screening tool for patients with OSA symptoms referred to a sleep clinic.  RESULTS Eighty-three out of 200 patients had a high risk of OSA based on the STOP-Bang questionnaire.  CONCLUSION The Arabic version of STOP-Bang questionnaire is an easy-to-use tool that can be implemented as a reliable, quick screening tool for OSA in patients referred to sleep clinic.  RECENT FINDINGS The STOP-Bang questionnaire was originally validated as a screening tool to identify surgical patients who are at high-risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).  We aimed to evaluate the validity of the STOP-Bang questionnaire to predict moderate-to-severe and severe OSA in the general population.  STUDY OBJECTIVE To determine if a high score (≥ 3) on the STOP-Bang screening questionnaire for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) predicts whether obese patients are at high risk for OSA and increased risk of difficult airway.  CONCLUSION The STOP-Bang questionnaire can be used as a screening tool in the general population in view of its moderate sensitivity and high negative predictive value for subjects with moderate-to-severe and severe OSA.  Subjects completed a questionnaire evaluating the presence and severity of AR and the STOP-BANG questionnaire (snoring, tiredness during daytime, observed apnea, high blood pressure, body mass index, age, neck circumference, gender), a validated screening method to identify obstructive sleep apnea syndrome risk.  The STOP-BANG questionnaire has been used to identify surgical patients at risk for undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by classifying patients as low risk (LR) if STOP-BANG score < 3 or high risk (HR) if STOP-BANG score ≥ 3.  The STOP-BANG questionnaire offers clinicians an efficient and objective tool for improving detection of OSA risk in MS patients.  PURPOSE This study aims: (1) to identify patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who are at high risk for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by utilizing the STOP-BANG questionnaire and (2) to evaluate the relationship between OSA risk as determined by the STOP-BANG questionnaire and self-reported sleepiness and fatigue using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), respectively.  CONCLUSIONS Over 40% of MS patients were identified as high risk for OSA based on the STOP-BANG questionnaire.  The high-risk group patients identified by STOP-BANG had significantly higher respiratory disturbance index and lower minimum oxygen saturation than the low-risk group patients. <br><b>CONCLUSION</b>: Among the four questionnaires studied, STOP-BANG, with only eight questions and the highest sensitivity, is the best questionnaire of the four for OSA screening.  <b>BACKGROUND</b>: The present study validates and evaluates the sensitivity and specificity of four internationally popular questionnaires, translated into Chinese, for assessing suspected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients, namely, the Berlin questionnaire, the ASA checklist, the STOP questionnaire and the STOP-BANG questionnaire.  We hypothesized that the STOP-Bang questionnaire, a screening tool for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), can predict difficult intubation. <br><b>PATIENTS AND METHODS</b>: In this prospective cohort study, 200 adult surgical patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia were studied to evaluate the usefulness of the STOP-Bang questionnaire for predicting difficult intubation.

"[SOC]###context: For patients who presented with epilepsy, the use of the antiepileptic drug VPA did not associate with survival when compared with patients who did not receive VPA treatment.  This prognostic effect is not solely explained by early diagnosis, and survival is not associated with VPA treatment.  Several in vivo and in vitro studies have indicated that VPA has radiosensitizing effects for gliomas and radioprotective influence on normal brain tissue or hippocampal neurons.  The results of several retrospective studies have also indicated potential benefit to improve survival of patients with GBM.  Moreover, the promising treatment results of a phase 2 trial of concurrent radiation therapy, temozolomide, and VPA for patients with GBM have been recently reported.   While there have not been any novel anti-GBM therapeutics approved for many years, there has been the gradual accumulation of clinical data suggesting that the widely used anti-convulsant agent, valproic acid (VPA) may significantly prolong survival in GBM patients.   Additionally, VPA may result in improved outcomes compared to historical data and merits further study.  Several retrospective studies in seizure patients with glioblastoma treated with chemotherapy have provided evidence for a moderately improved survival with the use of valproic acid, possibly due to inhibition of histone deacetylase Several clinical studies have reported that valproic acid could prolong survival of GBM patients While there have not been any novel anti-GBM therapeutics approved for many years, there has been the gradual accumulation of clinical data suggesting that the widely used anti-convulsant agent, valproic acid (VPA) may significantly prolong survival in GBM patients Prolonged survival with valproic acid use in the EORTC/NCIC temozolomide trial for glioblastoma Prolonged survival with valproic acid use in the EORTC/NCIC temozolomide trial for glioblastoma.  Valproic acid use during radiation therapy for glioblastoma associated with improved survival.  Patients receiving VPA alone (97 [16. 9%]) appeared to derive more survival benefit from TMZ/RT (hazard ratio [HR] 0. 39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0. 24-0. 63) than patients receiving an EIAED only (252 [44%]) (HR 0. 69, 95% CI 0. 53-0. 90) or patients not receiving any AED (HR 0. 67, 95% CI 0. 49-0. 93).   Several retrospective studies in seizure patients with glioblastoma treated with chemotherapy have provided evidence for a moderately improved survival with the use of valproic acid, possibly due to inhibition of histone deacetylase.  Several uncontrolled retrospective case series and a post hoc analysis of the registration trial for temozolomide indicated an association between valproic acid (VPA) use and improved survival outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. To confirm the hypothesis suggested above, a combined analysis of survival association of antiepileptic drug use at the start of chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide was performed in the pooled patient cohort (n = 1,869) of four contemporary randomized clinical trials in newly diagnosed glioblastoma: AVAGlio (Avastin in Glioblastoma; NCT00943826), CENTRIC (Cilengitide, Temozolomide, and Radiation T Several clinical studies have reported that valproic acid could prolong survival of GBM patients.

VPA may be preferred over an EIAED in patients with glioblastoma who require an AED during TMZ-based chemoradiotherapy.  The combination of radiotherapy, temozolomide and valproic acid (VPA) has shown some promise in retrospective analyses of patients with glioblastoma, although their mechanisms of action remain unknown. We investigated the in vitro and in vivo effects of pretreating glioma cells with temozolomide and VPA as an immunization strategy to boost an adaptive immune response in a syngeneic mouse model.

"[SOC]###context: LAF: Logic Alignment Free and its application to bacterial genomes classification.  In this paper, we present Logic Alignment Free (LAF), a method that combines alignment-free techniques and rule-based classification algorithms in order to assign biological samples to their taxa.  This method searches for a minimal subset of k-mers whose relative frequencies are used to build classification models as disjunctive-normal-form logic formulas (if-then rules).  We apply LAF successfully to the classification of bacterial genomes to their corresponding taxonomy.  In particular, we succeed in obtaining reliable classification at different taxonomic levels by extracting a handful of rules, each one based on the frequency of just few k-mers.  State of the art methods to adjust the frequency of k-mers to the character distribution of the underlying genomes have negligible impact on classification performance, suggesting that the signal of each class is strong and that LAF is effective in identifying it.

"[SOC]###context: Background.  Tretinoin has been shown to improve photoaged skin.  This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a 5% retinoic acid peel combined with microdermabrasion for facial photoaging.  . Conclusion.  This study demonstrated that 5% retinoic acid peel cream combined with microdermabrasion was safe and effective in the treatment of photoaging in the Iranian population.   CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with a double-conjugate retinoid cream demonstrated early reductions in photodamage and improvements in Hydration.  AHA-Ret induced less Erythema vs retinol and was more tolerable vs retinol and tretinoin.  These comparative products include prescription tretinoin, physician strength idebenone, kinetin, polyhydroxy, lactic and glycolic acids in reversing signs of photoaging.  CONCLUSION: Either topical tretinoin (0. 25%) or retinol (0. 25%) can be used safely and effectively when applied in office immediately after SA peeling to ameliorate signs of photoaging.  CONCLUSION: The treatment outcome of Retinol 0. 2%/LR2412 2% cream does not differ from the one of tretinoin 0. 025% cream.  Clinical results were not statistically different.   INTRODUCTION: Topical tretinoin is considered the gold standard to treat photoaged skin, but it is associated with side effects and only available upon prescription.  Tretinoin is commonly used topically for acne treatment and in the treatment of photoaging.  BACKGROUND: Topical tretinoin is effective treatment for both acne and photoaging.  The efficacy of tretinoin is well established in the treatment of acne and photoaged skin, however as a typical side effect of tretinoin treatment most patients develop a low-grade irritant dermatitis.  Topical tretinoin is established as an effective treatment for photoaging.  BACKGROUND Topical tretinoin is effective treatment for both acne and photoaging.  Tretinoin is the only pharmacologic compound shown to partially reverse some signs of photoaging.  Although once considered an irreversible process, it is now established that photoaging can be treated by topical tretinoin.  Moreover, studies that have elucidated photoaging pathophysiology have produced significant evidence that topical tretinoin (all-trans retinoic acid), the only agent approved so far for the treatment of photoaging, also works to prevent it.  BACKGROUND AND DESIGN The efficacy of topical tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic acid) in treating photoaging is well established.  MAJOR CONCLUSIONS Tretinoin can be used for photoaging treatment or combined treatment by different mechanisms.  Tretinoin is still the best tested retinoid to reverse photoaged skin.  The separation between clinical improvement and irritation suggests that mechanisms other than irritation dominate tretinoin-induced repair of photoaging in humans.  * A cream containing 0. 05% tretinoin (Retinova((R)) is approved for treatment of sun-induced skin damage (""photoaging"").

"[SOC]###context: Sentrin/small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-specific protease 2 (SENP2) has broad de-SUMOylation activities in vitro, which is essential for embryonic heart development.  Silencing SENP2 can reduce myostatin expression and, therefore, promote myogenesis of skeletal muscle.  These results reveal the important role of SENP2 in the regulation of myostatin expression and myogenesis.  Overexpression of c-Ski/SnoN also induces skeletal muscle differentiation, but how c-Ski/SnoN function in myogenesis is largely unknown.  Notably, loss of sumoylation in the Lys-50 site (via a Lys-to-Arg point mutation) potently activates muscle-specific gene expression and enhances myotube formation.  Our study suggests a novel role for SUMO modification in the regulation of myogenic differentiation.  Although this modification has little effect on SnoN repression of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter and only modestly potentiates SnoN repression of the p21 promoter, SnoN sumoylation robustly augments the ability of SnoN to suppress transcription of the myogenesis master regulatory gene myogenin Our study also points to a physiological role for SnoN sumoylation in the control of myogenin expression in differentiating muscle cells.  Here, we biochemically characterize SnoN sumoylation in detail and report the physiological function of the modification.   An essential role of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-specific Protease 2 in myostatin expression and myogenesis.  These results reveal the important role of SENP2 in the regulation of myostatin expression and myogenesis.  The E3 SUMO ligase Nse2 regulates sumoylation and nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation of skNAC-Smyd1 in myogenesis.  Sumoylation of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor sharp-1 regulates recruitment of the histone methyltransferase G9a and function in myogenesis.   We show that the overall load of sumoylated proteins present in myoblasts diminishes progressively throughout myogenesis These novel results suggest that protein sumoylation plays a pivotal role in myoblast differentiation and is required to regulate the activity of key targets downstream of MyoD and myogenin.  a composite sequence motif has recently been identified that couples phosphorylation, sumoylation, and perhaps also deacetylation to control transcriptional repression in stress response, mitogen and nuclear hormone signaling, myogenesis, and neuronal differentiation.  Mutation of these SUMO acceptor sites in Sharp-1 does not impact its subcellular localization but attenuates its ability to act as a transcriptional repressor and inhibit myogenic differentiation.  Consistently, co-expression of the SUMO protease SENP1 with wild type Sharp-1 abrogates Sharp-1-dependent inhibition of myogenesis.   Transforming growth factor-beta-independent regulation of myogenesis by SnoN sumoylation.  Ubiquitin Specific Protease 25 (USP25), a member of the deubiquitinase family, is involved in several disease-related signal pathways including myogenesis, immunity and protein degradation.    In addition, we show that the skNAC interaction partner Smyd1 contains a putative sumoylation motif and is sumoylated in muscle cells, with depletion of Mms21/Nse2 leading to reduced concentrations of sumoylated Smyd1.  Taken together, our data suggest that the function, specifically the balance between the nuclear and cytosolic roles, of the skNAC-Smyd1 complex might be regulated by sumoylation.

Down syndrome (DS), caused by trisomy of chromosome 21, Submicroscopic duplication of chromosome 21 and trisomy 21 phenotype (Down syndrome).  Trisomy 21 or Down syndrome is a chromosomal disorder resulting from the presence of all or part of an extra Chromosome 21.  Down syndrome is a genetic disorder, occurring when an individual has all or part of an extra copy of chromosome 21.  Downs syndrome (DS) occurs due to an extra copy of chromosome 21.  Down syndrome, which arises in individuals carrying an extra copy of chromosome 21, is associated with a greatly increased risk of early-onset Alzheimer disease.  Aneuploidy refers to the presence of an extra copy of a specific chromosome, or trisomy, as seen in Down's syndrome (trisomy 21), or the absence of a single chromosome, or monosomy, as seen in Turner syndrome (a single X chromosome in females: 45, X).  Down syndrome (DS) or Trisomy 21 (Ts21) is caused by the presence of an extra copy of all or part of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21) and is the most frequent survivable congenital chromosomal abnormality.

"[SOC]###context: Notch receptors participate in a highly conserved signalling pathway that regulates normal development and tissue homeostasis in a context- and dose-dependent manner.  Deregulated Notch signalling has been implicated in many diseases, but the clearest example of a pathogenic role is found in T-cell lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma (T-LL), in which the majority of human and murine tumours have acquired mutations that lead to aberrant increases in Notch1 signalling.  NOTCH proteins (NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NOTCH3 and NOTCH4) play crucial roles in embryonic development.  Also, mounting evidence indicates that NOTCH contributes to the pathogenesis of hematopoietic and solid malignancies.  Recent studies reported a high incidence of gain-of-function mutations of the NOTCH1 gene in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL).   Our data indicate that NOTCH1 is mutated in T-ALL, but not in other common human cancers, and that NOTCH2, NOTCH3 and NOTH4 genes are rarely mutated in common human cancers.   The Notch signaling pathway plays a critical role in maintaining the balance between cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, and is a highly conserved signaling pathway that regulates normal development in a context- and dose-dependent manner.  Dysregulation of Notch signaling has been suggested to be key events in a variety of hematological malignancies.  Notch1 signaling appears to be the central oncogenic trigger in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), in which the majority of human malignancies have acquired mutations that lead to constitutive activation of Notch1 signaling.  T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is characterized as a high-risk stratified disease associated with frequent relapse, chemotherapy resistance, and a poorer prognostic outlook than B-precursor ALL.  Many of the challenges in treating T-ALL reflect the lack of prognostic cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities on which to base therapy, including targeted therapy.  Notch1 activating mutations were identified in more than 50% of T-ALL cases and can be therapeutically targeted with γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs).   Notch1 is a transmembrane receptor that is frequently mutated in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).   T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL) is characterized by aberrant activation of NOTCH1 in over 60% of T-ALL cases.  The high prevalence of activating NOTCH1 mutations highlights the critical role of NOTCH signaling in the pathogenesis of this disease and has prompted the development of therapeutic approaches targeting the NOTCH signaling pathway.   Activating mutations in NOTCH1, an essential regulator of T cell development, are frequently found in human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).   NOTCH signaling pathway is essential in T-cell development and NOTCH1 mutations are frequently present in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).  Activating Notch-1 mutations are frequent in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), occurring in >50% of patients.  Mutations in NOTCH1/FBXW7 activate NOTCH signaling and are of prognostic significance in patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).  Gain-of-function mutations in Notch-1 have been reported in more than 50% of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).  Notch signaling is of crucial importance in normal T-cell development and Notch 1 is frequently mutated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL), leading to aberrantly high Notch signaling.  Activation of the Notch pathway occurs commonly in T acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) because of mutations in Notch1 or Fbw7 and is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and survival.  T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients frequently display NOTCH1 activating mutations and Notch can transcriptionally down-regulate the tumor suppressor PTEN.  The identification of activating mutations in NOTCH1 in over 50% of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL) has generated major interest in the elucidation of the mechanisms of transformation downstream of oncogenic NOTCH and in the targeting of the NOTCH signaling pathway in this disease.  BACKGROUND: In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL/LBL), activating mutations of NOTCH1 are observed in more than 50% of cases, whereas the t(7;9)(q34;q34) involving NOTCH1 at 9q34 and TRB@ at 7q34 is an extremely rare but recurrent translocation.  Activating mutations in NOTCH1 consitute the most prominent genetic abnormality in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).  T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive cancer that is frequently associated with activating mutations in NOTCH1 and dysregulation of MYC The Notch signaling pathway has been recognized as a key factor for the pathogenesis of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), because of the high incidence of activating mutations of Notch1 Notch signaling is of crucial importance in normal T-cell development and Notch 1 is frequently mutated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL), leading to aberrantly high Notch signaling NOTCH signaling pathway is essential in T-cell development and NOTCH1 mutations are frequently present in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) Activating Notch-1 mutations are frequent in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), occurring in >50% of patients Gain-of-function mutations in Notch-1 have been reported in more than 50% of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)

"[SOC]###context: The growth and differentiation factor bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) regulates cardiac development during vertebrate embryogenesis.  In cardiac precursor cells, BMP-2 has recently been shown to induce expression of cardiac transcription factors, including myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF-2A).  BMP-2 increased PI 3-kinase activity in these cells in a time-dependent manner, resulting in increased expression of sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (MHC) and MEF-2A.  Furthermore expression of MEF-2A increased MHC expression in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner.  Gene expression profiling revealed decreased levels of transcription factors transforming growth factor-β/bone morphogenetic protein, serum response factor, GATA4, and myocyte enhancer factor 2, linked to increased Ca(2+)-dependent calcineurin activity and Notch1 signaling that impaired ESC differentiation.  Dominant interference of calcineurin/mAKAP binding blunts the increase in MEF2 transcriptional activity seen during myoblast differentiation, as well as the expression of endogenous MEF2-target genes.  Furthermore, disruption of calcineurin binding to mAKAP in cardiac myocytes inhibits adrenergic-induced cellular hypertrophy.  Hypertrophic agonist stimulation of neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes increased Mef2 expression by enhancing its translation, without changing its transcription or blocking degradation of the protein.  MEF2 abundance was increased by Calcineurin overexpression in vivo and was reduced by Calcineurin inhibition in vitro, without affecting Mef2 mRNA levels.  In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) revealed association of Gli2 to the Mef2c gene, and of MEF2C to the Gli2 gene in differentiating P19 cells.  Finally, co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that Gli2 and MEF2C proteins formed a complex, capable of synergizing on cardiomyogenesis-related promoters containing both Gli- and MEF2-binding elements.  We propose a model whereby Gli2 and MEF2C bind each other's regulatory elements, activate each other's expression and form a protein complex that synergistically activates transcription, enhancing cardiac muscle development.   MC1568 arrests myogenesis by (i) decreasing myocyte enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D) expression, (ii) by stabilizing the HDAC4-HDAC3-MEF2D complex, and (iii) paradoxically, by inhibiting differentiation-induced MEF2D acetylation.  The myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) family of transcription factors is not only important for controlling gene expression in normal cellular programs, like muscle differentiation, T-cell apoptosis, neuronal survival, and synaptic differentiation, but has also been linked to cardiac hypertrophy and other pathological conditions.   Furthermore, the nuclear receptor corepressor SMRT (silencing mediator of retinoid acid and thyroid hormone receptor) stimulated the deacetylase activity of HDAC3 towards MEF2 and PCAF.  Supporting the physical interaction and deacetylase activity, HDAC3 repressed MEF2-dependent transcription and inhibited myogenesis.   The myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) proteins are MADS-box transcription factors that are essential for differentiation of all muscle lineages but their mechanisms of action remain largely undefined.   Inactivation of the MEF2C gene causes cardiac developmental arrest and severe downregulation of a number of cardiac markers including atrial natriuretic factor (ANF).  We provide evidence that MEF2 proteins are recruited to target promoters by the cell-specific GATA transcription factors, and that MEF2 potentiates the transcriptional activity of this family of tissue-restricted zinc finger proteins.  During differentiation into cardiac muscle, Nkx2-5 expression resulted in the activation of myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C), but not MEF2A, -B, or -D Similar to Nkx2-5, MEF2C expression initiated cardiomyogenesis, resulting in the up-regulation of Brachyury T, bone morphogenetic protein-4, Nkx2-5, GATA-4, cardiac alpha-actin, and myosin heavy chain expression.  These findings indicate the presence of a positive regulatory network between Nkx2-5 and MEF2C and show that both factors can direct early stages of cell differentiation into a cardiomyogenic pathway.

A profound ultrasound screening of the organs should be performed in case of lithium exposition, whereas newer studies showed no increase in risk for Ebstein anomaly.   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: In the 1970s a very strong association was suggested between maternal lithium treatment during pregnancy and Ebstein's anomaly of the heart in the offspring.   No women who took lithium during pregnancy were found among four case-control studies of Ebstein's anomaly involving 25, 34, 59, and 89 affected children, respectively.  In two cohort studies, risk ratios of 3. 0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1. 2 to 7. 7) and 1. 5 (95% CI, 0. 4 to 6. 8) for all congenital anomalies have been observed.  [Ebstein's anomaly of the tricuspid valve following prenatal exposure to lithium].  An Ebstein's anomaly was diagnosed, with tricuspid valve insufficiency.  Exposure to lithium in utero was established.  Literature reports indicate an association between exposure to lithium in utero and cardiac anomalies, notably Ebstein's anomaly.  Lithium is widely used in the treatment of bipolar affective disorders, and teratogenic effects include cardiovascular abnormalities, notably Ebstein anomaly.   Some studies suggest that lithium might be involved as a teratogen increasing the incidence of Ebstein's anomaly in the offspring of female patients with manio-depressive psychosis and lithium-administered during pregnancy.   Cross-sectional echocardiography was used to evaluate two neonates whose mothers ingested lithium during pregnancy.  In one infant, Ebstein's anomaly of the tricuspid valve was identified.  In the other infant cross-sectional echocardiography provided reassurance that the infant did not have Ebstein's anomaly.   It is thought that this malformation is due to a direct teratogenic effect of lithium on the atrioventricular junction.  When lithium hurts: a look at Ebstein anomaly.  Some studies suggest that lithium might be involved as a teratogen increasing the incidence of Ebstein's anomaly in the offspring of female patients with manio-depressive psychosis and lithium-administered during pregnancy.  The search terms were lithium, pregnancy, teratogen, abnormalities (drug induced), Ebstein's anomaly, and adverse effects. <br><b>DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS</b>: In the 1970s a very strong association was suggested between maternal lithium treatment during pregnancy and Ebstein's anomaly of the heart in the offspring.  In-utero exposure to lithium during the first trimester of pregnancy might be associated with an increased risk of cardiac malformations, especially the rare Ebstein's anomaly.  DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS In the 1970s a very strong association was suggested between maternal lithium treatment during pregnancy and Ebstein's anomaly of the heart in the offspring.  BACKGROUND There has been concern that exposure to lithium early in pregnancy may be associated with a marked increase in the risk of Ebstein's anomaly (a right ventricular outflow tract obstruction defect) in infants and overall congenital cardiac defects, but data are conflicting and limited.  CONCLUSIONS Maternal use of lithium during the first trimester was associated with an increased risk of cardiac malformations, including Ebstein's anomaly; the magnitude of this effect was smaller than had been previously postulated.  Our data suggest that Ebstein's anomaly is associated with maternal mental health problems generally rather than lithium or benzodiazepines specifically; therefore, changing or stopping medications may not be preventative.  A profound ultrasound screening of the organs should be performed in case of lithium exposition, whereas newer studies showed no increase in risk for Ebstein anomaly.  Lithium exposure during the first trimester seems to increase the risk of congenital heart disease, especially Ebstein's anomaly.  Reported neonatal problems with maternal lithium therapy include Ebstein's anomaly, poor respiratory effort and cyanosis, rhythm disturbances, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, thyroid dysfunction, hypoglycemia, hypotonia and lethargy, hyperbilirubinemia, and large-for-gestational-age infants.  All case control studies regarding Ebstein's anomaly were negative, and among 222 infants with Ebstein's anomaly and 44 with tricuspid atresia none of the mothers had taken lithium during pregnancy.  1 patient in the lithium group chose to terminate pregnancy after Ebstein's anomaly was detected by a prenatal echocardiogram.  When lithium hurts: a look at Ebstein anomaly.  Literature reports indicate an association between exposure to lithium in utero and cardiac anomalies, notably Ebstein's anomaly.  In the 1970s a very strong association was suggested between maternal lithium treatment during pregnancy and Ebstein's anomaly of the heart in the offspring.

"[SOC]###context: All patients were given specific antiviral therapy (oseltamivir).  Oseltamivir (has known by its brand name 'Tamiflu') is a prodrug, requiring ester hydrolysis for conversion to the active form, Oseltamivir carboxylate.  Oseltamivir was the first orally active neuraminidase inhibitor commercially developed by US based Gilead Sciences and is currently marketed by F.  Hoffmann-La Roche (Roche).  Oseltamivir is an antiviral drug which works by blocking the function of the viral neuraminidase protein.  US FDA approved Oseltamivir for prophylaxis of uncomplicated influenza A and B.  Currently, Oseltamivir is the only first line defense drug available for the treatment of Swine Flu.   The latter is the binding cavity for 3 currently used neuraminidase inhibitors: oseltamivir (Tamiflu), zanamivir (Relenza) and peramivir; thus, the drugs should remain effective for treatment.   Though therapeutic dose of oseltamivir was given as antiviral treatment for the early therapy, and other therapeutic measures such as energetic respiratory and circulatory support, and immunosuppressant therapy were given Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), a neuraminidase inhibitor, is widely used for treatment of influenza.  Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), a neuraminidase inhibitor, is effective for treating both seasonal flu and H5N1 influenza A virus infection.  BACKGROUND: Oseltamivir phosphate (OP; Tamiflu) is a prodrug of the anti-influenza neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) and has been developed for the treatment and prevention of both A and B strains of influenza.  Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is currently the frontline antiviral drug employed to fight the flu virus in infected individuals by inhibiting neuraminidase, a flu protein responsible for the release of newly synthesized virions.  Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is the most important antiviral drug available and a cornerstone in the defence against a future influenza pandemic.  The country where oseltamivir is used most is Japan, where it is used to treat seasonal flu.  Oseltamivir safety and tolerability were verified in patients with new variant infection A/H1N1.  To investigate oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate pharmacokinetics in critically ill patients who were receiving continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Prospective, open-label, pharmacokinetic study. Intensive care units of an academic medical center. Thirteen critically ill patients aged 13 years or older with suspected or confirmed H1N1 influenza who had a prescription for oseltamivir and were concurrently receiving CVVHD and/or ECMO between October 2009 and January 2010. Oseltamivir 150 mg was administered nasogastrically or nasoenterically every 12 hours The study included 3351 patients in whom influenza had been diagnosed by use of an antigen detection test kit. Oseltamivir was administered to 1818 patients with influenza A and 1485 patients with influenza B.  No anti-influenza drugs were administered to 21 patients with influenza A or to 27 patients with influenza B.  Patients receiving oseltamivir therapy were divided into 4 groups according to the time between the onset of fever (temperature, > or = 37. 5 degrees C) and administration of the first dose of oseltamivir (0-12 h, 13-24 h, 25-36 h, and 37-48 h) To clarify the usefulness of oseltamivir in the elderly we administered oseltamivir to all residents when an influenza A outbreak occurred in a nursing home. Sixty-eight residents in the nursing home were investigated in which the influenza A outbreak occurred; 32 residents had fever and 28 residents were positive for influenza A with direct enzyme immunoassay. Oseltamivir was administered at 75 mg twice daily for 5 days to all residents. Oseltamivir almost inhibited symptom onset in the influenza A-positive afebrile group Oseltamivir was administered to patients with influenza like illness and confirmed influenza, while their close contacts were given oseltamivir prophylactically Insights from investigating the interaction of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) with neuraminidase of the 2009 H1N1 swine flu virus.  Evaluation of treatment with Oseltamivir during the 2009 H1N1 (swine flu) pandemic: the problem of incomplete clinical information.  Immunological effects of the orally administered neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir in influenza virus-infected and uninfected mice.  Oral oseltamivir improves pulmonary function and reduces exacerbation frequency for influenza-infected children with asthma.  Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is a potent and selective antiviral drug employed to fight the flu virus in infected individuals by inhibiting neuraminidase (NA), a flu protein responsible for the release and spread of the progeny virions.  Oseltamivir is an antiviral drug which works by blocking the function of the viral neuraminidase protein.  Neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (Oseltamivir and Zanamivir) are presently used as an anti-flu drugs.  US FDA approved Oseltamivir for prophylaxis of uncomplicated influenza A and B.  Currently, Oseltamivir is the only first line defense drug available for the treatment of Swine Flu.  Oseltamivir and Zanamivir have good number of interactions with H1N1 2009 virus and the scoring function also support to this result.  The number of interaction and scoring function shows that Oseltamivir and Zanamivir will be able to effectively control the present pandemic H1N1 virus 2009.  Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), a neuraminidase inhibitor, is effective for treating both seasonal flu and H5N1 influenza A virus infection.  Oseltamivir is generally well tolerated, and its most common adverse effects are nausea and vomiting.  Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is currently the frontline antiviral drug employed to fight the flu virus in infected individuals by inhibiting neuraminidase, a flu protein responsible for the release of newly synthesized virions.  However, oseltamivir resistance has become a critical problem due to rapid mutation of the flu virus.  Approximately 1. 4% of tested isolates are oseltamivir resistant.  We report a patient with an underlying hematological malignancy who was hospitalized with influenza A (H1N1) swine-origin and whose strain developed oseltamivir resistance during therapy.  Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), a neuraminidase inhibitor, is widely used for treatment of influenza.  Because abnormal behaviors have been observed in some Japanese teenagers following oseltamivir use, its safety has been questioned.  Oseltamivir is known to alter neuronal function and behavior in animals, particularly when administered in combination with ethanol.  Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), a neuraminidase inhibitor, is effective for treating both seasonal flu and H5N1 influenza A virus infection.  Oseltamivir is generally well tolerated, and its most common adverse effects are nausea and vomiting.  However, neuropsychiatric behaviors including jumping and falling from balconies by young patients being treated by oseltamivir have been reported from Japan; this has led to warnings against its prescribing by many authorities.  However, oseltamivir resistance has become a critical problem due to rapid mutation of the flu virus.  We observed also 10 infections A/H1N1 influenza during pregnancy, with good oseltamivir tolerance and without recent perinathal complications. CONCLUSIONS: Among 109 individuals with swine flu influenza, 67% have not complicated clinical manifestation and they recovered during 3-4 days.  The number of interaction and scoring function shows that Oseltamivir and Zanamivir will be able to effectively control the present pandemic H1N1 virus 2009. .  Most reported that oseltamivir was an effective treatment for the flu.  It is needed to perform surveillance on oseltamivir resistance in swine flu.  The neuraminidase (NA) of influenza virus is the target of anti-flu drugs oseltamivir and zanamivir.  According to one trial, oseltamivir was moderately effective as a prophylactic for close contacts of 'flu cases (6. 6% in absolute values).  Oseltamivir: a first line defense against swine flu.  Oseltamivir administered daily for six weeks by the oral route is safe and effective for the prevention of influenza. . 
###question: What is the function of Oseltamivir when administered during flu?[EOC] [SOR]###response: Oseltamivir (has known by its brand name 'Tamiflu') is a prodrug, requiring ester hydrolysis for conversion to the active form, Oseltamivir carboxylate.

"[SOC]###context: We identify CNOT3 as a tumor suppressor mutated in 7 of 89 (7. 9%) adult T-ALLs, and its knockdown causes tumors in a sensitized Drosophila melanogaster model.  In addition, we identify mutations affecting the ribosomal proteins RPL5 and RPL10 in 12 of 122 (9. 8%) pediatric T-ALLs, with recurrent alterations of Arg98 in RPL10.  ARID5B as a critical downstream target of the TAL1 complex that activates the oncogenic transcriptional program and promotes T-cell leukemogenesis.  The oncogenic transcription factor TAL1/SCL induces an aberrant transcriptional program in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells.  Our results indicate that ARID5B reinforces the oncogenic transcriptional program by positively regulating the TAL1-induced regulatory circuit and MYC in T-ALL, thereby contributing to T-cell leukemogenesis.  TAL1 as a master oncogenic transcription factor in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  BACKGROUND: T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a hematologic malignancy characterized by T-cell proliferation, and in many cases, the ectopic expression of the oncogenic transcription factor T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia protein 1 (TAL1).  MiR-7 Functions as a Tumor Suppressor by Targeting the Oncogenes TAL1 in T-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.  Aberrant expression of transcription factor oncogenes such as HOX11, HOX11L2, TAL1/SCL, LYL1, LMO1, and LMO2 can be detected in lymphoblasts from up to 80% of patients with acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).  The transcription factor TAL1/SCL is one of the most prevalent oncogenes in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a malignant disorder resulting from leukemic transformation of thymus T-cell precursors.  TAL1 as a master oncogenic transcription factor in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia The transcription factor TAL1/SCL is one of the most prevalent oncogenes in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a malignant disorder resulting from leukemic transformation of thymus T-cell precursors.   The oncogenic transcription factor TAL1/SCL is aberrantly expressed in over 40% of cases of human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), emphasizing its importance in the molecular pathogenesis of T-ALL.  H The Tal1 oncogene is a class II basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, overexpressed in as much as 60% of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases.  Li SCL/TAL1 (stem cell leukemia/T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia [T-ALL] 1) is an essential transcription factor in normal and malignant hematopoiesis.  It Previous results indicated that miR-146b-5p is downregulated by TAL1, a transcription factor critical for early hematopoiesis that is frequently overexpressed in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) where it has an oncogenic role.

"[SOC]###context: We have investigated the molecular basis for decreased muscle chloride conductance in the myotonic goat, an historically important animal model for the elucidation of the role of chloride in muscle excitation.  A single nucleotide change causing the substitution of proline for a conserved alanine residue in the carboxyl terminus of the goat muscle chloride channel (gCIC-1) was discovered.  The nondystrophic myotonias are rare muscle hyperexcitability disorders caused by gain-of-function mutations in the SCN4A gene or loss-of-function mutations in the CLCN1 gene he observed phenotype resembled congenital myotonia caused by CLCN1 mutations in goats and humans.   Nondystrophic myotonias are characterized by muscle stiffness triggered by voluntary movement.  They are caused by mutations in either the CLCN1 gene in myotonia congenita or in the SCN4A gene in paramyotonia congenita and sodium channel myotonias.  Thomsen's and Becker's diseases are the most prevalent nondystrophic myotonias.  Their frequency varies, according to different sources, from 1 : 100 000 to 1 : 10 000.  Thomsen's myotonia is autosomal dominant, and Becker's myotonia is autosomal recessive.  Both diseases result from mutations of the CLCN1 gene encoding chloride ion channels of skeletal muscles.  Thomsen's (TM) and Becker's (BM) Myotonias are nondystrophic myotonias.  At present, 150 mutations in the CLCN1 gene, which results in the development of TM and BM, have been described.   Based on the results of a molecular-genetic analysis of CLCN1 gene in patients with nondystrophic myotonias, Mutations in the genes encoding chloride (ClC-1) or sodium (SCN4A) channels expressed exclusively in skeletal muscle cause nondystrophic myotonias.   Mutations in the genes encoding chloride (ClC-1) or sodium (SCN4A) channels expressed exclusively in skeletal muscle cause nondystrophic myotonias.  INTRODUCTION: Mutations of the voltage-gated sodium channel gene (SCN4A), which encodes Nav1. 4, cause nondystrophic myotonia that occasionally is associated with severe apnea and lary ations in the genes encoding chloride (ClC-1) or sodium (SCN4A) channels expressed exclusively in skeletal muscle cause nondystrophic myotonias.  Genetic  Nondystrophic myotonias are disorders of Na+ (Nav1. 4 or SCN4A) and Cl- (CLCN1) channels in skeletal muscles, and frequently show phenotype heterogeneity.  Currently, four genes are identified to be involved in myotonia: the muscle voltage-gated sodium and chloride channel genes SCN4A and CLCN1, the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) gene, and the CCHC-type zinc finger, nucleic acid binding protein gene CNBP.  Mutations in the skeletal muscle voltage-gated sodium channel alpha-subunit gene (SCN4A) have been associated with a spectrum of inherited nondystrophic myotonias and periodic paralyses.  Myotonic dystrophy Type 1 is caused by CTG repeat expansion in the 3' untranslated region in the Dystrophia Myotonica Protein Kinase (DMPK) gene.  Identification and Functional Characterization of CLCN1 Mutations Found in Nondystrophic Myotonia Patients.  The nondystrophic myotonias are rare muscle hyperexcitability disorders caused by gain-of-function mutations in the SCN4A gene or loss-of-function mutations in the CLCN1 gene.  INTRODUCTION: Mutations of the voltage-gated sodium channel gene (SCN4A), which encodes Nav1. 4, cause nondystrophic myotonia that occasionally is associated with severe apnea and Becker syndrome, a recessive nondystrophic myotonia caused by mutations in the chloride channel 1 gene (CLCN1), is characterized by delayed muscle relaxation after contraction.  Autosomal dominant myotonia congenita or Thomsen's disease and autosomal recessive myotonia congenita or Becker's are rare nondystrophic disorders due to allelic mutations of the muscle chloride channel gene, CLCN1.  Therefore we analyzed genetic mutations in CLCN1 and SCN4A in 10 Chinese families clinically diagnosed with Non-dystrophic myotonias.

They were assessed using SCOPA, Hoehn and Yahr Scale (HYS), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale 2nd version (PDSS-2), Non-motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS), Montgomery Asberg Depression Scale (MADS), 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ39), Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire (NOHQ), and Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behaviour Disorder Questionnaire (RBDQ).   The median PD questionnaire 39-score index (PDQ39-SI) was 23. 22% and the most affected dimension was ""mobility. ""  In the 43% of cases in whom oral therapy was changed, total UPDRS improved significantly (effect size = 8) as did the PDQ39 in cases reaching target.  NMS Quest and MOCA scores also improved significantly.  This study shows that many people in a representative cohort of PD would benefit from objective assessment and treatment of their PD features against a target.  Here, we applied a novel diffusion-weighted imaging approach, diffusion MRI connectometry, to investigate the correlation of quality of life, evaluated by Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ39) with the white matter structural connectivity in 27 non-demented PD patients (disease duration of 5. 3 ± 2. 9 years, H and Y stage = 1. 5 ± 0. 6, UPDRS-III = 13. 7 ± 6. 5, indicating unilateral and mild motor involvement).   The present study aimed to assess the beneficial and side effects of STN DBS in Moroccan Parkinsonian patients.  Material and Methods: Thirty five patients underwent bilateral STN DBS from 2008 to 2016 in the Rabat University Hospital.  Patients were assessed preoperatively and followed up for 6 to 12 months using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale in four conditions (stimulation OFF and ON and medication OFF and ON), the levodopa-equivalent daily dose (LEDD), dyskinesia and fluctuation scores and PDQ39 scale for quality of life (QOL).  The total K-SCOPA-AUT score showed a positive correlation with other non-motor symptoms [the Korean version of non-motor symptom scale (K-NMSS)], activities of daily living (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part II) and quality of life [the Korean version of Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life 39 (K-PDQ39)].  METHODS: Static posturography (Centre of Pressure -CoP- parameters), gait (the Ten-Meter Walk Test [TMWT]), freezing of gait (the Freezing of Gait Questionnaire [FOG-Q]), the motor portion of the Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) and patient-perceived quality of life (the 39-item Parkinson's disease Questionnaire [PDQ39]), were assessed at pre-test, post-test, and re-test.  The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapy in nonmotor symptoms (NMS) for Parkinson disease (PD) is growing worldwide.  Well-performed, systematic evidence-based research is largely lacking in this area and many studies include various forms of CAM with small patient numbers and a lack of standardization of the approaches studied.  Taichi, Qigong, dance, yoga, mindfulness, acupuncture, and other CAM therapies are reviewed and there is some evidence for the following: Taichi in sleep and PDQ39; dance in cognition, apathy, and a mild trend to improved fatigue; yoga in PDQ39; and acupuncture in depression, PDQ39, and sleep.  One hundred thirty patients with PD completed a booklet of questionnaires, which included the PDQ39 as a disease-specific measure of QoL, a symptom checklist, a mobility checklist, as well as patient ratings of disease stage and disability.

Mutations in the COL5A1 and COL5A2 genes, which encode type V collagen, have been identified in several individuals.  Most mutations affect either the triple-helical domain of the protein or the expression of one COL5A1 allele We identified a novel splice-acceptor mutation (IVS4-2A-->G) in the N-propeptide-encoding region of COL5A1, in one patient with EDS type I Mutations of the alpha2(V) chain of type V collagen impair matrix assembly and produce ehlers-danlos syndrome type I We have identified mutations of the COL5A2 gene, which encodes the alpha2(V) chain of type V collagen, in two unrelated patients with the severe type I form of EDS Our findings show that heterozygous mutations of the COL5A2 gene can produce the EDS type I phenotype A splice-junction mutation in the region of COL5A1 that codes for the carboxyl propeptide of pro alpha 1(V) chains results in the gravis form of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (type I) We report that genomic polymorphisms at the pro alpha 1(V) gene (COL5A1) locus cosegregated with the gravis form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) (type I) in a three generation family Since exon 65 encodes 78 residues of the carboxyl propeptide, the expected result of this mutation is reduced efficiency in incorporating mutant pro alpha 1(V) chains into type V collagen molecules and reduced type V collagen synthesis These studies indicate that heterozygous mutations in COL5A1 can result in EDS type I The gene encoding collagen alpha1(V)(COL5A1) is linked to mixed Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type I/II Recently, genetic linkage has been demonstrated between the COL5A1 gene, which encodes the alphal chain of type V collagen, and EDS type II in a large British kindred Using a polymorphic intragenic simple sequence repeat at the COL5A1 locus, we now demonstrate tight linkage to EDS type I/II in a three-generation family The variation in expression in this family suggests that EDS types I and II are allelic, and the linkage data support the hypothesis that mutation in COL5A1 can cause both phenotypes.  Null alleles of the COL5A1 gene of type V collagen are a cause of the classical forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (types I and II).

This method learns the parameters of the features, which are embedded in the naïve Bayes classifier  non-interacting proteins (NIPs) is important for training the algorithms to predict protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and for assessing the false positive rates of PPI detection efforts.  We present the second version of Negatome, Negatome is derived by manual curation of literature and by analyzing three-dimensional structures of protein complexes.  Identification of protein-ligand binding site is an important task in structure-based drug design and docking algorithms Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to cluster the pockets that are most likely to bind ligands with the attributes of geometric characteristics, interaction potential, offset from protein, conservation score and properties surrounding the pockets Predicting protein complexes from protein-protein interaction data is becoming a fundamental problem in computational biology.  The identification and characterization of protein complexes implicated are crucial to the understanding of the molecular events under normal and abnormal physiological conditions a novel graph mining algorithm (PEWCC) to identify such protein complexes.  Firstly, the algorithm assesses the reliability of the interaction data, then predicts protein complexes based on the concept of weighted clustering coefficient.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the performance of PEWCC was compared to several methods We developed a novel PTM refinement algorithm, iPTMClust, which extends a recently introduced PTM refinement algorithm PTMClust and uses a non-parametric Bayesian model to better account for uncertainties in the quantity and identity of PTMs in the input data.  The use of this new modeling approach enables iPTMClust to provide a confidence score per modification site that allows fine-tuning and interpreting resulting PTM predictions We develop an algorithm for identifying protein complexes by considering these two types of complexes separately.  We test our algorithm on a few yeast protein interaction networks, and show that our algorithm is able to identify complexes more accurately than existing algorithms.  A software program NDComplex Studying protein complexes is very important in biological processes since it helps reveal the structure-functionality relationships in biological networks and much attention has been paid to accurately predict protein complexes from the increasing amount of protein-protein interaction (PPI) data  To provide an investigation of the roles of edges in PPI networks, we show that the edges connecting less similar vertices in topology are more significant in maintaining the global connectivity, indicating the weak ties phenomenon in PPI networks Identification of protein complexes in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks is the first step in understanding the organization and dynamics of cell function.  We have developed an algorithm PROCOMOSS (Protein Complex Detection using Multi-objective Evolutionary Approach based on Semantic Similarity) for partitioning the whole PPI network into clusters, which serve as predicted protein complexes.  With the exponentially growing amount of protein sequence data, an exploration of new methods that predict protein interaction sites based solely on sequence information is becoming increasingly urgent This paper describes a new method that predicts interaction sites based on protein sequences by integrating five different algorithms employing meta-method, Majority Vote and SVMhmm Regression techniques The 'metaPIS' web-server was implemented for meta-prediction.   In this paper, a novel protein complex identifying method, named EPOF, is proposed, using essential proteins and the local metric of vertex fitness We compare the performances of EPOF to other ten previous algorithms, including EAGLE, NFC, MCODE, DPClus, IPCA, CPM, MCL, CMC, SPICi, and Core-Attachment.   We compare the performance of ProRank to some of the well known protein complex prediction methods (ClusterONE, CMC, CFinder, MCL, MCode and Core) in terms of precision and recall In this paper we evaluated four different clustering algorithms using six different interaction datasets.  We parameterized the MCL, Spectral, RNSC and Affinity Propagation algorithms and applied them to six PPI datasets produced experimentally by Yeast 2 Hybrid (Y2H) and Tandem Affinity Purification (TAP) methods this paper, we present a new topology-based algorithm, HKC, to detect protein complexes in genome-scale PPI networks.  HKC mainly uses the concepts of highest k-core and cohesion to predict protein complexes by identifying overlapping clusters.    Protein complexes are important entities to organize various biological processes in the cell, like signal transduction, gene expression, and molecular transmission.  In most cases, proteins perform their intrinsic tasks in association with their specific interacting partners, forming protein complexe Macropol et al.  proposed a protein complex prediction algorithm, called RRW, which repeatedly expands a current cluster of proteins according to the stationary vector of a random walk with restarts with the cluster whose proteins are equally weighted.  In the cluster expansion, all the proteins within the cluster have equal influences on determination of newly added protein to the cluster.  In this paper, we extend the RRW algorithm by introducing a random walk with restarts with a cluster of proteins, each of which is weighted by the sum of the strengths of supporting evidence for the direct physical interactions involving the protein.  The resulting algorithm is called NWE (Node-Weighted Expansion of clusters of proteins).   In this paper, we propose a new topological model by extending the definition of k-clique community of algorithm CPM and introduced distance restriction, and develop a novel algorithm called CP-DR based on the new topological model for identifying protein complexes This paper also describes a random forest classifier which can effectively combine the structure-based prediction results and other functional annotations together to predict protein interactions Here we explain the development and implementation of a novel Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction Engine termed PIPE.

"[SOC]###context: Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a multifactorial, non-mendelian disorder in which rare high-penetrance coding sequence mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase RET contribute to risk in combination with mutations at other genes In this study, we review the identification of genes and loci involved in the non-syndromic common form and syndromic Mendelian forms of Hirschsprung's disease.  The majority of the identified genes are related to Mendelian syndromic forms of Hirschsprung's disease.  The non-Mendelian inheritance of sporadic non-syndromic Hirschsprung's disease proved to be complex; involvement of multiple loci was demonstrated in a multiplicative model Coding sequence mutations in e. g.  RET, GDNF, EDNRB, EDN3, and SOX10 lead to long-segment (L-HSCR) as well as syndromic HSCR but fail to explain the transmission of the much more common short-segment form (S-HSCR).  Furthermore, mutations in the RET gene are responsible for approximately half of the familial and some sporadic cases, strongly suggesting, on the one hand, the importance of non-coding variations and, on the other hand, that additional genes involved in the development of the enteric nervous system still await their discovery For almost all of the identified HSCR genes incomplete penetrance of the HSCR phenotype has been reported, probably due to modifier loci.  Therefore, HSCR has become a model for a complex oligo-/polygenic disorder in which the relationship between different genes creating a non-mendelian inheritance pattern still remains to be elucidated  Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a multifactorial, non-mendelian disorder in which rare high-penetrance coding sequence mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase RET contribute to risk in combination with mutations at other genes.   The inheritance of Hirschsprung disease is generally consistent with sex-modified multifactorial inheritance with a lower threshold of expression in males.  Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a multifactorial, non-mendelian disorder in which rare high-penetrance coding sequence mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase RET contribute to risk in combination with mutations at other genes.  Differential contributions of rare and common, coding and noncoding Ret mutations to multifactorial Hirschsprung disease liability.  BACKGROUND: RET is the major gene associated to Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) with differential contributions of its rare and common, coding and noncoding mutations to the multifactorial nature of this pathology.  In the etiology of Hirschsprung disease various genes play a role; these are: RET, EDNRB, GDNF, EDN3 and SOX10, NTN3, ECE1, Mutations in these genes may result in dominant, recessive or multifactorial patterns of inheritance.  Chromosomal and related Mendelian syndromes associated with Hirschsprung's disease.  The majority of the identified genes are related to Mendelian syndromic forms of Hirschsprung's disease In the etiology of Hirschsprung disease various genes play a role; these are: RET, EDNRB, GDNF, EDN3 and SOX10, NTN3, ECE1, Mutations in these genes may result in dominant, recessive or multifactorial patterns of inheritance On the basis of a skewed sex-ratio (M/F = 4/1) and a risk to relatives much higher than the incidence in the general population, HSCR has long been regarded as a sex-modified multifactorial disorder The inheritance of Hirschsprung disease is generally consistent with sex-modified multifactorial inheritance with a lower threshold of expression in males The non-Mendelian inheritance of sporadic non-syndromic Hirschsprung's disease proved to be complex; involvement of multiple loci was demonstrated in a multiplicative model

"[SOC]###context: Chromosome XII context is important for rDNA function in yeast The rDNA cluster in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is located 450 kb from the left end and 610 kb from the right end of chromosome XII and consists of approximately 150 tandemly repeated copies of a 9. 1 kb rDNA unit To explore the biological significance of this specific chromosomal context, chromosome XII was split at both sides of the rDNA cluster and strains harboring deleted variants of chromosome XII consisting of 450 kb, 1500 kb (rDNA cluster only) and 610 kb were created.  In the strain harboring the 1500 kb variant of chromosome XII consisting solely of rDNA, the size of the rDNA cluster was found to decrease as a result of a decrease in rDNA copy number These observations suggest that the context of chromosome XII plays an important role in maintaining a constant rDNA copy number and in physiological processes related to rDNA function in S. cerevisiae.  Notably, strains harboring the 450 kb chromosome XII variant and/or the 1500 kb variant consisting solely of rDNA had shorter life spans than wild type and also accumulated extrachromosomal rDNA circles Condensation of a unique region of chromosome XVI and the highly repetitive ribosomal DNA (rDNA) cluster from chromosome XII were also examined in budding yeast.

Clonal size-variation of rDNA cluster region on chromosome XII of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  Using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), we have demonstrated clonal variation in the size of chromosome XII in a diploid strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae X2180-2D.  The sizes of the two chromosome XII homologues were very different: 2600 (L-type) and 1450 kb (S-type).  The size variation was shown to be derived from size changes in the rDNA cluster region, which is present in chromosome XII, by digesting the chromosome with XhoI, whose cutting site is not present in a rDNA repeat unit, and hybridizing to rDNA probes.

"[SOC]###context: For women with hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer, endocrine therapies, including the selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen, the aromatase inhibitors anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane, and the selective estrogen receptor degrader fulvestrant, are recommended in clinical guidelines.  Here we describe and characterize a novel, orally bioavailable small-molecule selective estrogen receptor degrader, RAD1901, and evaluate its therapeutic potential for the treatment of breast cancer.  Identification of GDC-0810 (ARN-810), an Orally Bioavailable Selective Estrogen Receptor Degrader (SERD) that Demonstrates Robust Activity in Tamoxifen-Resistant Breast Cancer Xenografts.  Fulvestrant is a steroid-based, selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) that both antagonizes and degrades ER-α and is active in patients who have progressed on antihormonal agents.   Evaluation of the pharmacological activities of RAD1901, a selective estrogen receptor degrader.  However, being the only SERD currently known to access the brain, RAD1901 merits evaluation as a targeted therapy for the treatment of breast cancer brain metastases.  Tamoxifen, toremifene, and the selective estrogen receptor degrader fulvestrant are used to treat breast cancer, and tamoxifen and raloxifene protect against breast cancer in high-risk women.  The turnover of estrogen receptor α by the selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) fulvestrant is a saturable process that is not required for antagonist efficacy.

"[SOC]###context: Our results showed that BDH2 expression was decreased, intracellular iron was increased, global DNA hydroxymethylation level was elevated, while methylation level was reduced in lupus CD4+ T cells compared with healthy controls Altered DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation as well as histone modifications mediate changes in chromatin accessibility and gene expression in immune cells from SLE patients.  DNA hydroxymethylation was more recently identified as an activating epigenetic mark.  On the other hand, certain miRNAs, RFX1, defective ERK pathway signaling, Gadd45α and DNA hydroxymethylation have been proposed as potential mechanisms leading to DNA hypomethylation in lupus.  Increased 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in CD4(+) T cells in systemic lupus erythematosus.   Indeed, there is increasing evidence that SLE is characterized by widespread epigenetic changes.  5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) is a newly discovered modified form of cytosine suspected to be an important epigenetic modification in embryonic development, cell differentiation and cancer.   Through a combined analysis of differential DNA hydroxymethylation profile and gene expression profile in SLE CD4(+) T cells, we found 131 genes with the increased 5-hmC in promoter regions and up-regulated expression in SLE CD4(+) T cells compared with healthy controls, including selected immune-related genes, i. e.  SOCS1, NR2F6 and IL15RA Furthermore, we demonstrate that CTCF, as a transcription factor, can mediate DNA hydroxymethylation and contribute to overexpression of SOCS1 in CD4(+) T cells through binding to the promoter region of SOCS1.  DNA hydroxymethylation contributes to the aberrant regulation of genes transcription in the pathogenesis of SLE.  Here we investigated whether 3-hydroxy butyrate dehydrogenase 2 (BDH2), a modulator of intracellular iron homeostasis, was involved in regulating DNA hypomethylation and hyper-hydroxymethylation in lupus CD4<br> DNA methylation dynamics have already been implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE, while little is known about hydroxymethylation in this process.

"[SOC]###context: Sleep bruxism is prevalent in GERD patients, and GERD is highly associated with SB.  There was a statistical trend towards tooth wear progression being associated with gastric risk factors (p < 0. 05).   This article presents a case report of a 27-year-old male smoker with tooth wear and dentin sensitivity caused by GERD associated with bruxism.   The aim of this cross-over, randomized, single-blinded trial was to examine whether intra-esophageal acidification induces sleep bruxism (SB).   RMMA episodes including SB were induced by esophageal acidification.   Chronic regurgitation of gastric acids in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease may cause dental erosion, which can lead in combination with attrition or bruxism to extensive loss of coronal tooth tissue.  This clinical report describes treatment of severe tooth wear of a gastroesophageal reflux disease patient who is 54-year-old Turkish male patient.  After his medical treatment, severe tooth wear, bruxism and decreased vertical dimensions were determined.   Gastroesophageal reflux disease by itself or in combination with attrition, abrasion or bruxism may be responsible for the loss.  The association between bruxism, feeding and smoking habits and digestive disorders may lead to serious consequences to dental and related structures, involving dental alterations (wear, fractures and cracks), periodontal signs (gingival recession and tooth mobility) and muscle-joint sensitivity, demanding a multidisciplinary treatment plan.  This paper presents a case report in which bruxism associated with acid feeding, smoking habit and episodes of gastric reflow caused severe tooth wear and great muscular discomfort with daily headache episodes.   The frequencies of RMMA, single short-burst, and clenching episodes were significantly higher during decreased esophageal pH episodes than those during other times.   These results suggest that most jaw muscle activities, ie, RMMA, single short-burst, and clenching episodes, occur in relation to gastroesophageal reflux mainly in the supine position.  Nocturnal bruxism may be secondary to nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux, occurring via sleep arousal and often together with swallowing.

"[SOC]###context: Determination of fetal rhesus d status by maternal plasma DNA analysis.  In this study, we assessed the feasibility of fetal RhD genotyping by analysis of cell-free fetal DNA(cffDNA) extracted from plasma samples of Rhesus (Rh) D-negative pregnant women by using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).  Performing real-time PCR on cffDNA showed accurate, efficient and reliable results, allowing rapid and high throughput non invasive determination of fetal sex and RhD status in clinical samples Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of fetal RhD by using free fetal DNA The aim of this study is to determine fetal RhD status in the Rh incompatible pregnancies with an non-invasive technique; free fetal DNA isolation from maternal circulation.   The detection of fetal RhD status by using a non-invasive method from maternal circulation was found to be possible.  Assessing fetal RhD status non-invasively by using free fetal DNA in maternal blood will be cost-efficient, avoiding unnecessary indirect Coombs test and unnecessary Rhogam applications that is used in RH incompatible pregnancies.  Fruitful research efforts have resulted in the clinical implementation of a number of non-invasive prenatal tests based on maternal plasma DNA analysis and included tests for fetal sex assessment, fetal rhesus D blood group genotyping and fetal chromosomal aneuploidy detection.  Non-invasive antenatal diagnosis of fetal rhesus status in an alloimmunised patient.  Our subsequent investigations have shown that this elevation in fetal cell traffic may serve as an early marker for those pregnancies at risk for this disorder. A very recent exciting discovery has been that free extracellular fetal DNA can be detected in the plasma and serum of pregnant women, which may permit the rapid and accurate detection of uniquely fetal loci, such as the fetal rhesus D gene in rhesus D negative pregnant women.  Fetal rhesus D (RhD) status determination using circulating cell-free fetal DNA from maternal plasma or serum is now recognized in Europe as a reliable and useful tool.  NGS is now sufficiently sensitive to analyze circulating fetal DNA in maternal blood (cell-free fetal DNA, cffDNA), enabling applications such as non invasive diagnosis of fetal sex (and X-linked diseases), fetal rhesus among rhesus-negative women, trisomy and, in the near future, Mendelian mutations High throughput non-invasive determination of foetal Rhesus D status using automated extraction of cell-free foetal DNA in maternal plasma and mass spectrometry Non-invasive RNA-based determination of fetal Rhesus D type: a prospective study based on 96 pregnancies.  BACKGROUND: Analysis of cell free fetal (cff) DNA in maternal plasma is used routinely for non invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) of fetal sex determination, fetal rhesus D status and some single gene disorders.   Fruitful research efforts have resulted in the clinical implementation of a number of non-invasive prenatal tests based on maternal plasma DNA analysis and included tests for fetal sex assessment, fetal rhesus D blood group genotyping and fetal chromosomal aneuploidy detection.   Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis and testing by analysis of cell-free DNA in the maternal circulation is a rapidly evolving field.  Current clinical applications include fetal sex determination, fetal rhesus D determination, the diagnosis of some single gene disorders, and a highly accurate screening test for aneuploidies.

"[SOC]###context: X-linked myotubular myopathy (MTM) is a severe neuromuscular disease of infancy caused by mutations of MTM1, which encodes the phosphoinositide lipid phosphatase, myotubularin As a gene for X linked MTM was recently identified in Xq28, we screened the obligatory carrier mothers for mutation.  We found a 4 bp deletion in exon 4 of the MTM1 gene, X-linked Myotubular Myopathy has clearly shown the benefits to be gained from a multinational research consortium with a common interest in identifying and cloning the MTM1 gene.  Myotubular myopathy (MTM1) is an X-linked disease, characterized by severe neonatal hypotonia and generalized muscle weakness, with pathological features suggesting an impairment in maturation of muscle fibres.  The MTM1 gene encodes a protein (myotubularin) with a phosphotyrosine phosphatase consensus.  myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), a severe congenital muscular disorder due to loss-of-function mutations in the MTM1 gene, We established a colony of dogs that harbor an X-linked MTM1 missense mutation. Muscle from affected male dogs exhibits reduction and altered localization of the MTM1 gene product, myotubularin, and provides a model analogous to X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a rare congenital myopathy, usually characterized by severe hypotonia and respiratory insufficiency at birth, in affected, male infants.  The disease is causally associated with mutations in the MTM1 gene, coding for phosphatase myotubularin.  Mutations in the MTM1 gene encoding myotubularin cause X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), a well-defined subtype of human centronuclear myopathy.  MTM1 gene sequencing revealed a unique exon 7 variant in all seven affected males, causing a nonconservative missense change, p. N155K, which haplotype data suggest derives from a recent founder in the local population.  X-linked centronuclear myopathy (XLMTM), also called myotubular myopathy, is a severe congenital myopathy characterized by generalized hypotonia and weakness at birth and the typical histological finding of centralization of myo-nuclei.  It is caused by mutations in the MTM1 gene encoding the 3-phosphoinositides phosphatase myotubularin.  sequencing all MTM1 exons X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), a severe congenital disorder due to loss of function mutations in the MTM1 gene, encoding myotubularin, a phosphoinositide phosphatase thought to have a role in plasma membrane homeostasis and endocytosis.  Mutations in the gene encoding the phosphoinositide phosphatase myotubularin 1 protein (MTM1) are usually associated with severe neonatal X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM).  However, mutations in MTM1 have also been recognized as the underlying cause of ""atypical"" forms of XLMTM in newborn boys, female infants, female manifesting carriers and adult men.  X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), a recessive disorder, is caused by mutations affecting the myotubulatin (MTM1) gene located on the X chromosome.  Most of the affected males die in the early postnatal period whereas female carriers are usually asymptomatic.  The authors present a patient with the most severe X-linked recessive type (XLMTM).  The diagnosis was confirmed and further specified by genetic analysis, revealing a novel frameshift mutation (1314-1315insT) of the myotubularin-coding MTM1 gene.  X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a congenital muscle disorder caused by mutations in the MTM1 gene.  MTM1, the gene encoding myotubularin (MTM1), is mutated in the X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), a severe genetic muscular disorder Myotubularin is a ubiquitously expressed phosphatase that acts on phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate [PI(3)P], a lipid implicated in intracellular vesicle trafficking and autophagy.  It is encoded by the MTM1 gene, which is mutated in X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), a muscular disorder characterized by generalized hypotonia and muscle weakness at birth leading to early death of most affected males.  The entire coding sequence of the gene was screened in 10 XLMTM patients using this technique.  X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM; OMIM# 310400) is a severe congenital muscle disease caused by mutations in the myotubularin (MTM1) gene.  Mutations in the MTM1 gene cause X-linked recessive myotubular myopathy (XLMTM; MIM310400).  We screened 29 independant patients with XLMTM phenotype and four with centronuclear myopathy.  87% (21/24) of patients with known MTM1 mutations showed abnormal myotubularin levels, including some with missense mutations.  X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) characteristically causes severe or fatal muscle weakness in male infants.  Mutations in the gene MTM1, encoding the protein myotubularin, can be identified in most families.  X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a congenital muscular disease characterized by severe hypotonia and generalized muscle weakness, leading in most cases to early postnatal death.  The gene responsible for the disease, MTM1, encodes a dual specificity phosphatase, named myotubularin, which is highly conserved throughout evolution.  X-linked recessive myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a muscle disorder usually affecting newborn males.  In the majority of cases, muscle weakness and hypotonia lead to a rapid demise at neonatal age.  The responsible MTM1 gene is located in proximal Xq28.  X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a severe congenital muscle disorder due to mutations in the MTM1 gene.  X-linked recessive myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is characterized by severe hypotonia and generalized muscle weakness, with impaired maturation of muscle fibres.  The gene responsible, MTM1, was identified recently by positional cloning, and encodes a protein (myotubularin) with a tyrosine phosphatase domain (PTP).  X-linked recessive myotubular myopathy (XLMTM; MTM1) is a severe neonatal disorder often causing perinatal death of the affected males.  The responsible gene, designated MTM1, was localized to proximal Xq28 and recently isolated.  The characterization of MTM1 allowed us to screen for causing mutations in three families, previously investigated by linkage analysis.  Using exon amplification, single strand conformation polymorphism, and subsequent sequencing analysis, three new mutations and their mutational origin were characterized by analyzing 10 exons.

"[SOC]###context: Significant decreases and progressively higher reductions of systolic and diastolic blood pressure were observed after RSD.  The complication rate was minimal.   In conclusion, the RSD presents itself as an effective and safe approach to resistant hypertension.  Renal sympathetic denervation delivers not only a decrease in blood pressure levels but also renal as well as systemic sympathetic nerve activity.  The reduction in blood pressure appears to be sustained over 3 years after the procedure, which implies no counterregulatory mechanism or re-innervation of afferent renal sympathetic nerve so far.  Renal sympathetic denervation not only reduces blood pressure but also renal as well as systemic sympathetic nerve activity in such patients.  The reduction in blood pressure appears to be sustained over 3 years after the procedure, which suggests absence of re-innervation of renal sympathetic nerves.  Safety appears to be adequate.  Clinical trials of renal sympathetic denervation have shown significant reductions in blood pressure in these patients.  Renal sympathetic denervation also reduces heart rate, which is a surrogate marker of cardiovascular risk.   Small studies suggest that RSD can produce dramatic blood pressure reductions: In the randomized Symplicity HTN-2 trial of 106 patients, the mean fall in blood pressure at 6 months in patients who received the treatment was 32/12 mm Hg.  However, there are limitations to the evidence for RSD in the treatment of resistant hypertension.  These include the small number of patients studied; the lack of any placebo-controlled evidence; the fact that blood pressure outcomes were based on office assessments, as opposed to 24-hour ambulatory monitoring; the lack of longer-term efficacy data; and the lack of long-term safety data.  Clinical evaluation of selective renal sympathetic denervation demonstrated a decrease of renal norepinephrine spillover and renin activity, an increase of renal plasma flow, and has confirmed clinically significant, sustained reductions in blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension.  In addition to drug treatment, baroreceptor stimulation therapy and renal sympathetic denervation are promising new approaches in this group of patients.  Early clinical evaluation with catheter-based, selective renal sympathetic denervation in patients with resistant hypertension has mechanistically correlated sympathetic efferent denervation with decreased renal norepinephrine spillover and renin activity, increased renal plasma flow, and has demonstrated clinically significant, sustained reductions in blood pressure.  The SYMPLICITY HTN-3 Trial is a pivotal study designed as a prospective, randomized, masked procedure, single-blind trial evaluating the safety and effectiveness of catheter-based bilateral renal denervation for the treatment of uncontrolled hypertension despite compliance with at least 3 antihypertensive medications of different classes (at least one of which is a diuretic) at maximal tolerable doses.

"[SOC]###context: Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process known to contribute to metastasis in cancer and it is mainly characterized by loss of E-cadherin expression.  The TGF-β signaling pathway has an established role in promoting EMT by down-regulating E-cadherin via a number of transcription factors, such as Twist, Snail and Slug.  EMT has also been reported to produce cells with stem cell-like properties.   Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been hypothesized as a mechanism by which cells change phenotype during carcinogenesis, as well as tumor metastasis.   Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a complex process in which epithelial cells acquire the characteristics of invasive mesenchymal cells.  EMT has been implicated in cancer progression and metastasis as well as the formation of many tissues and organs during development.  Epithelial cells undergoing EMT lose cell-cell adhesion structures and polarity, and rearrange their cytoskeletons.  Several oncogenic pathways such as transforming growth factor (TGF) -β, Wnt, and Notch signaling pathways, have been shown to induce EMT.  These pathways have activated transcription factors including Snail, Slug, and the ZEB family which work as transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin, thereby making epithelial cells motile and resistant to apoptosis.   Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is suggested to be crucial for the development of an invasive and metastatic carcinoma cell phenotype.  Therefore, the definition of this phenotype is of great clinical interest.   Recent work has suggested that there may be a linkage between the stem cell phenotype and that induced by the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).  EMT plays an important role in cell movement and organ formation during embryogenesis, and it is currently hypothesized to be a major mechanism by which epithelial cancers may generate cells that can form metastases.   The term EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) is used in many settings.  This term is used to describe the mechanisms facilitating cellular repositioning and redeployment during embryonic development and tissue reconstruction after injury.  Recently, EMT has also been applied to potential mechanisms for malignant progression and has appeared as a specific diagnostic category of tumors.  The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a fundamental process governing morphogenesis in multicellular organisms.  This process is also reactivated in a variety of diseases including fibrosis and in the progression of carcinoma.

The ADAR RNA editing enzyme controls neuronal excitability in Drosophila melanogaster In Drosophila, many messenger RNAs involved in neuro-transmission are re-coded at the RNA level by the RNA-editing enzyme, dADAR, leading to the incorporation of amino acids that are not directly encoded by the genome.  dADAR also re-codes its own transcript, but the consequences of this auto-regulation in vivo are unclear Novel putative nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit genes, Dalpha5, Dalpha6 and Dalpha7, in Drosophila melanogaster identify a new and highly conserved target of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA-mediated A-to-I pre-mRNA editing The genome of the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, contains a single gene encoding the enzyme responsible for deamination, termed ADAR (for adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) Using these and other available data, we discovered and analyzed thousands of neuronal human and mouse circRNAs.  circRNAs were extraordinarily enriched in the mammalian brain, well conserved in sequence, often expressed as circRNAs in both human and mouse, and sometimes even detected in Drosophila brains.  circRNAs were overall upregulated during neuronal differentiation, highly enriched in synapses, and often differentially expressed compared to their mRNA isoforms.  circRNA expression correlated negatively with expression of the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 While several ADAR enzymes are present in mice, the presence of a single ADAR in Drosophila, combined with the diverse genetic toolkit available to researchers and the wide range of ADAR target mRNAs identified to date, make Drosophila an ideal organism to study the genetic basis of A-to-I RNA editing Aside from their role in generating protein diversity in the central nervous system, ADARs have been implicated in the hypermutation of some RNA viruses, although why this hypermutation occurs is not well understood. Here we describe the hypermutation of adenosines to guanosines in the genome of the sigma virus--a negative sense RNA virus that infects Drosophila melanogaster The genome of the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, contains a single gene encoding the enzyme responsible for deamination, termed ADAR (for adenosine deaminase acting on RNA).  The enzyme has no activity on dsRNA substrates but is a tRNA deaminase with specificity for adenosine 37 of insect alanine tRNA.  dADAT1 shows greater similarity to vertebrate ADARs than to yeast Tad1p, supporting the hypothesis of a common evolutionary origin for ADARs and ADATs.  dAdat1 transcripts are maternally supplied in the egg.

Here we describe the hypermutation of adenosines to guanosines in the genome of the sigma virus--a negative sense RNA virus that infects Drosophila melanogaster.  The RNA editing enzyme ADAR chemically modifies adenosine (A) to inosine (I), which is interpreted by the ribosome as a guanosine.  In Drosophila, many messenger RNAs involved in neuro-transmission are re-coded at the RNA level by the RNA-editing enzyme, dADAR, leading to the incorporation of amino acids that are not directly encoded by the genome.  Drosophila melanogaster has a single Adar gene encoding a protein related to mammalian ADAR2 that edits transcripts encoding glutamate receptor subunits.  While several ADAR enzymes are present in mice, the presence of a single ADAR in Drosophila, combined with the diverse genetic toolkit available to researchers and the wide range of ADAR target mRNAs identified to date, make Drosophila an ideal organism to study the genetic basis of A-to-I RNA editing.

Thyroid dysfunction, particularly sick euthyroid syndrome, was found to be related to in-hospital and long term mortality in patients with STEMI undergoing primary percutaneous intervention.  A low fT3 level, a common phenomenon in patients with acute myocardial infarctions, is a strong predictor of short-term and long-term poor prognoses in patients with acute myocardial infarctions.

"[SOC]###context: The responses to IV KCl were attenuated by concomitant furosemide (p = 0. 01), amphotericin B (p < 0. 01), and KCl in parenteral nutrition (p < 0. 01).  The responses were augmented by concomitant enalapril To determine whether an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril, prevents cardiac function deterioration (defined using maximal cardiac index [MCI] on exercise testing or increase in left ventricular end-systolic wall stress [LVESWS]) in long-term survivors of pediatric cancer.  Enalapril treatment did not influence exercise performance, but did reduce LVESWS in the first year Patients with intraatrial baffle procedure for transposition of the great arteries (TGA) have diastolic dysfunction, decreased exercise capacity, stroke volume response and elevated systemic vascular resistance (SVR) during exercise.  We conclude that short-term (<1 year) use of enalapril does not improve exercise performance in patients with TGA in whom the intraatrial baffle procedure has been performed.  A common late effect of doxorubicin therapy for childhood cancer is reduced left-ventricular (LV) wall thickness resulting in elevated LV afterload and depressed LV function.  Many children are given angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which have been studied primarily in adults.  We document the long-term effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in doxorubicin-treated survivors of childhood cancer.  In doxorubicin-treated long-term survivors of childhood cancer, enalapril-induced improvement in LV structure and function is transient.  The primary defect, which is LV wall thinning, continues to deteriorate, and thus the short-term improvement was mostly related to lowered diastolic blood pressure.  Patients who have undergone the Fontan procedure have decreased cardiac output, increased systemic vascular resistance, abnormal diastolic function, and decreased exercise capacity compared with normal people.  We conclude that enalapril administration for 10 weeks does not alter abnormal systemic vascular resistance, resting cardiac index, diastolic function, or exercise capacity in patients who have undergone a Fontan procedure.  Angiotensin convertase inhibitor (Enalapril) was used in 51 children aged 4 days up to 18 years (mean 4. 3 +/- 5. 5, years).  As many as 27 subjects were newborns (4) and infants (23).  The patients suffered from circulatory insufficiency due to congestive cardiomyopathy (13 cases).  6 treated subjects suffered from circulatory insufficiency due to congenital heart malformations before cardiac surgery and 22 after it (including complex malformations operated according to Fontan method).  10 children were treated because of arterial hypertension.  4 subjects suffered form life-threatening arrhythmias coexisting with circulatory insufficiency.  4 patients (8%) died during treatment but their deaths can not be related to angiotensin convertase inhibitor therapy.  In the other children (82%) the beneficial influence of angiotensin convertase inhibitor use was found (improvement in comparison with the state before convertase inhibitor introduction).  In 10% of subjects enalapril did not show any significant therapeutic effect We conclude that the combination of ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker deserves further exploration for inclusion in any management regimen for the treatment of muscular dystrophy-associated cardiomyopathy.  Addition of these medications, never before attempted in the management of cardiomyopathy associated with generalized myopathic disease, complemented each other in relieving symptoms and reversing signs of congestive heart failure and DCM.  Enalapril was clinically safe and effective for children with cardiac failure secondary to ventricular impairment, valvar regurgitation, or after cardiac surgery.  Renal failure was a problem in young infants with left-to-right shunts.  In a tertiary referral centre 63 patients underwent 67 treatment periods with enalapril.  The median age was 5. 4 months.  All children had signs of heart failure: congestive cardiac failure with breathlessness at rest was present in 88%.  Haemodynamic groups were left-to-right shunt (n = 15), impaired ventricular function (n = 14), after cardiac surgery (n = 23), valvar regurgitation (n = 12), and hypertension (n = 3).  Serial clinical, radiological, and laboratory data were used to judge outcome.  The mean (SD) maximal dose was 0. 30 (0. 21) mg/kg/day.  Thirty nine (58%) patients improved, 20 (30%) showed no improvement, and eight (12%) had side effects requiring discontinuation of enalapril.  We studied the inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in eight infants with congestive heart failure (CHF) poorly controlled with digoxin and diuretics, treated orally with 0. 25 mg kg-1 enalapril maleate once a day In infants with CHF, mean baseline ACE activity was significantly higher than in control infants Converting enzyme inhibitors may benefit ""heart failure"" associated with large ventricular septal defects and normal or mildly elevated pulmonary resistance.

"[SOC]###context: Developmental progress of germ cells through meiotic phases is closely tied to ongoing meiotic recombination.  In mammals, recombination preferentially occurs in genomic regions known as hotspots; the protein that activates these hotspots is PRDM9, In mammals, genetic recombination during meiosis is limited to a set of 1- to 2-kb regions termed hotspots.  Their locations are predominantly determined by the zinc finger protein PRDM9, which binds to DNA in hotspots Meiotic recombination ensures proper segregation of homologous chromosomes and creates genetic variation.  In many organisms, recombination occurs at limited sites, termed 'hotspots', whose positions in mammals are determined by PR domain member 9 (PRDM9) These results, which provide the first detailed mapping of PRDM9 binding to DNA and, to our knowledge, the most detailed analysis yet of DNA binding by a long zinc-finger array, make clear that the binding specificities of PRDM9, and possibly other long-array zinc-finger proteins, are unusually complex.  PRDM9 is a major determinant of meiotic recombination hotspots in humans and mice.   Here, we demonstrate that a major player for hotspot specification is the Prdm9 gene.  During mammalian meiosis, double-strand breaks are deliberately made throughout the genome and then repaired, leading to the exchange of genetic material between copies of chromosomes.  How the locations of breaks are specified was largely unknown until a fortuitous confluence of statistical genetics and molecular biology uncovered the role of PRDM9, a DNA binding protein In many mammals, including humans and mice, the zinc finger histone methyltransferase PRDM9 performs the first step in meiotic recombination by specifying the locations of hotspots, the sites of genetic recombination.  These results, together with the fact that PRDM9 is the only known mammalian histone methyltransferase with both H3K4 and H3K36 trimethylation activity, suggest that trimethylation of H3K36 plays an important role in the recombination process.

These similarities suggest that some Alu family sequences are mobile genetic elements that can transpose to new chromosomal loci using as an intermediate a cDNA copy of an RNA transcribed from the Alu family element by RNA polymerase III.  Primate and rodent genomes are populated with hundreds of thousands copies of Alu and B1 elements dispersed by retroposition, i. e. , by genomic reintegration of their reverse transcribed RNAs.  Members of this family are readily transcribed in vitro by RNA polymerase III, but RNA corresponding to only a small sub-set of Alu elements has been found in vivo.  Alu interspersed repetitive elements possess internal RNA polymerase III promoters which are strongly transcribed in vitro, yet these elements are nearly silent in somatic cells.  The amplification of genomic Alu elements by retroposition, i. e.  by reintegration of reverse-transcribed RNA, suggests that Alu RNA plays an important role in this process.  We report enzymatic studies of the secondary structure of Alu RNAs transcribed in vitro from two recently retroposed Alu elements.  The results of this study indicate that Alu and 7SL RNA gene sequences interact with cellular factors that are important for HeLa cell proliferation and suggest that these pol III-transcribed elements may be involved in the regulation of cellular growth.  Then we used primer extension analysis to determine the level of polymerase III directed Alu RNA and found an increased expression of Alu RNA in hepatocellular carcinoma Alu interspersed repetitive elements possess internal RNA polymerase III promoters which are strongly transcribed in vitro, yet these elements are nearly silent in somatic cells 'Free Alu RNAs' are transcribed by Pol III from their own promoter, while 'embedded Alu RNAs' are transcribed by Pol II as part of protein- and non-protein-coding RNAs We report enzymatic studies of the secondary structure of Alu RNAs transcribed in vitro from two recently retroposed Alu elements Transcribed Alu sequences can alter splicing patterns by generating new exons, but other impacts of intragenic Alu elements on their host RNA are largely unexplored Both 7SL genes and Alu elements are transcribed by RNA polymerase III, and we show here that the internal 7SL promoter lies within the Alu-like part of the 7SL gene Each group revealed a divergent pattern of transcribed Alu elements
###question: Are Alu elements transcribed?[EOC] [SOR]###response: A significant percentage of the more than 1 million copies of Alu elements was shown to be transrcribed.  Free Alu RNAs are known to be transcribed by Pol III from their own promoter.  On the other hand, embedded Alu RNAs are transcribed by Pol II as part of protein- and non-protein-coding RNAs.  Recent studies have demonstrated that both free and embedded Alu RNAs play a major role in post transcriptional regulation of gene expression. [EOR]"

"[SOC]###context: Ataxin-2 is an evolutionarily conserved protein first identified in humans as responsible for spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2).  The molecular basis of SCA2 is the expansion of a polyglutamine tract in Ataxin-2, encoding a Lsm domain that may bind RNA and a PAM2 motif that enables interaction with the poly (A) binding protein.  In SCA2 brains, we found cytoplasmic, but not nuclear, microaggregates.  Mice expressing ataxin-2 with Q58 showed progressive functional deficits accompanied by loss of the Purkinje cell dendritic arbor and finally loss of Purkinje cells.  Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominantly inherited, neurodegenerative disease caused by an expansion of polyglutamine tracts in the cytosolic protein ataxin-2 (Atx2).   Our analysis provides valuable information on the evolution and domain structure of Ataxin-2 proteins.  Proline-rich motifs that may mediate protein interactions are widespread in Ataxin-2 proteins, but expansion of polyglutamine tracts associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, is present only in primates, as well as some insects.  The expansion of a polyQ repeat within the ataxin-2 protein causes spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2).  However, neither the precise pathological mechanism nor the physiological functions of ataxin-2 are known.

"[SOC]###context: DeepCC: a novel deep learning-based framework for cancer molecular subtype classification.  Molecular subtyping of cancer is a critical step towards more individualized therapy and provides important biological insights into cancer heterogeneity.  Although gene expression signature-based classification has been widely demonstrated to be an effective approach in the last decade, the widespread implementation has long been limited by platform differences, batch effects, and the difficulty to classify individual patient samples.  Here, we describe a novel supervised cancer classification framework, deep cancer subtype classification (DeepCC), based on deep learning of functional spectra quantifying activities of biological pathways.  In two case studies about colorectal and breast cancer classification, DeepCC classifiers and DeepCC single sample predictors both achieved overall higher sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy compared with other widely used classification methods such as random forests (RF), support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and multinomial logistic regression algorithms.  Simulation analysis based on random subsampling of genes demonstrated the robustness of DeepCC to missing data.  Moreover, deep features learned by DeepCC captured biological characteristics associated with distinct molecular subtypes, enabling more compact within-subtype distribution and between-subtype separation of patient samples, and therefore greatly reduce the number of unclassifiable samples previously.  In summary, DeepCC provides a novel cancer classification framework that is platform independent, robust to missing data, and can be used for single sample prediction facilitating clinical implementation of cancer molecular subtyping.

After 15 months, due to tumor progression and brain metastasis, he started with administration of anti-PD-1 blockade Camrelizumab (200 mg q2w) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).   We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of the anti-PD-1 antibody camrelizumab versus investigator's choice of chemotherapy in previously treated patients.  This study aimed to assess the antitumour activity and safety of the anti-PD-1 inhibitor camrelizumab in pretreated patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.  In our present report, we described a newly diagnosed non-small-cell lung cancer patient who suffered from focal vitiligo for approximately ten years and was treated with the anti-programmed cell death-1 receptor antibody camrelizumab (SHR-1210), which accelerated the aggravation of depigmentation of the skin over the whole body in just half a year.  PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this open-label, single-arm, phase II study, the safety and efficacy of combined regimen of chemotherapy consisting of gemcitabine, vinorelbine, and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (GVD) plus anti-PD-1 antibody camrelizumab was assessed in rrPMBCL.   Apatinib plus camrelizumab (anti-PD1 therapy, SHR-1210) for advanced osteosarcoma (APFAO) progressing after chemotherapy: a single-arm, open-label, phase 2 trial.  We further benchmarked the dissociation kinetics for three clinically approved PD-1 blockade mAbs (Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab, and Camrelizumab), intriguingly correlating well with the objective response rates in the hepatocellular carcinoma second-line treatment.  Purpose: Camrelizumab inhibits PD-1 in non-clinical models and showed typical non-clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety profiles for an IgG4 monoclonal antibody.   Camrelizumab is a programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor.  sions: Our findings suggest that (I) PD-1 targeted immunotherapy with toripalimab, camrelizumab, or sintilimab yielded a promising outcome in Chinese HBV patients with HCC and that (II) immunotherapy was well tolerated generally and had manageable side effects.

C RT OPINION: Camrelizumab is a selective, humanized, high-affinity IgG4 kappa mAb against PD-1.  Ca INTRODUCTION: Camrelizumab (also known as SHR-1210), a humanized monoclonal antibody against PD-1, has been shown to block the binding of PD-1 to PD-L1 and consequently inhibit the immune escape of tumor cells The structure of the camrelizumab/PD-1 complex reveals that camrelizumab mainly utilizes its heavy chain to bind to PD-1, while the light chain sterically inhibits the binding of PD-L1 to PD-1.  Here, we demonstrate varied N-glycan composition in PD-1, and show that the binding affinity of camrelizumab, a recently approved PD-1-specific MAb, to non-glycosylated PD-1 proteins from E.  coli is substantially decreased compared with glycosylated PD-1.

PURPOSE: We assessed the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab (an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody) plus apatinib (a vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGFR]-2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor) in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).  However, all three patients responded to low-dose decitabine, an epigenetic drug, in combination with camrelizumab (anti-PD-1 antibody), with only controllable adverse events, indicating that low-dose decitabine can sensitize PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.

Due to limited solubility and poor ionization of bilirubin and its glucuronide, the formation of estradiol 3-glucuronide was used as a surrogate to assess UGT1A1 activity, while the transport of pitavastatin, CDCF, and taurocholate were used as surrogate probe substrates to monitor the function of OATP1B1/OATP1B3, MRP2, and BSEP, respectively.  OATP1B1 and OATP1B3-mediated transport of bilirubin was confirmed and inhibition was determined for atazanavir, rifampicin, indinavir, amprenavir, cyclosporine, rifamycin SV and saquinavir.

Using mice deficient in Oatp1a/1b and in the multispecific sinusoidal export pump Abcc3, we found that Abcc3 secretes bilirubin conjugates into the blood, while Oatp1a/1b transporters mediate their hepatic reuptake.   Bilirubin elimination is a multifaceted process consisting of uptake of bilirubin into the hepatocytes facilitated by OATP1B1 and OATP1B3.   OATP1B1 polymorphism is a major determinant of serum bilirubin level but not associated with rifampicin-mediated bilirubin elevation.

"[SOC]###context: Antisense-mediated exon skipping therapy is a promising therapeutic approach that uses short DNA-like molecules called antisense oligonucleotides (AOs) to skip over/splice out the mutated part of the gene to produce a shortened but functional dystrophin protein many DMD patients need exon skipping of multiple exons in order to restore the reading frame, depending on how many base pairs the mutated exon(s) and adjacent exons have.  Theoretically, multiple exon skipping could be used to treat approximately 90%, 80%, and 98% of DMD patients with deletion, duplication, and nonsense mutations, respectively Antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) that bind to complementary sequences of the dystrophin pre-mRNA to induce skipping of the targeted exon by modulating pre-mRNA splicing are promising therapeutic agents for DMD.  Such AONs can restore the open reading frame of the DMD gene and produce internally deleted, yet partially functional dystrophin protein isoforms in skeletal muscle Of all novel molecular interventions currently being investigated for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, perhaps the most promising method aiming to restore dystrophin expression to diseased cells is known as 'exon skipping' or splice-modulation, whereby antisense oligonucleotides eliminate the deleterious effects of DMD mutations by modulating dystrophin pre-messenger RNA splicing, such that functional dystrophin protein is produced.  We previously conducted a proof of principle; dose escalation study in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients using the morpholino splice-switching oligonucleotide AVI-4658 (eteplirsen) that induces skipping of dystrophin exon 51 in patients with relevant deletions, restores the open reading frame and induces dystrophin protein expression after intramuscular (i. m. ) injection Using antisense oligonucleotides (AONs), the disrupted DMD reading frame is restored, allowing generation of partially functional dystrophin and conversion of a severe Duchenne into a milder Becker muscular dystrophy phenotype.   Using antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) targeting specific exons the DMD reading frame is restored and partially functional dystrophins are produced.

"[SOC]###context: Diagnosing acute HIV infection at point of care: a retrospective analysis of the sensitivity and specificity of a fourth-generation point-of-care test for detection of HIV core protein p24.  Previous evaluation of the fourth-generation Alere Determine HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab Combo POCT showed only 50% sensitivity for HIV core protein p24 (p24 antigen) detection, which is suboptimal for diagnosis of acute HIV infection with limited advantage over third-generation POCT.  CONCLUSIONS: This new POCT shows improved sensitivity for detection of p24 antigen and may be of value for clinical use in detecting acute HIV infection.  While fourth generation antigen-antibody combination assays have been successful in high-resource settings, rapid point of care (POC) versions of these assays have yet to demonstrate high sensitivity to detect AHI.   STUDY DESIGN: A total of 30,201 sera were tested for HIV diagnosis using Abbott Architect®HIV-Ag/Ab-Combo 4th-gen-EIA at a hospital in Spain during 17 months.   OBJECTIVE: To determine if fourth-generation antigen/antibody (Ag/Ab) rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) would have detected HIV infection earlier than the third-generation RDT used in MTN-003 (VOICE).  BACKGROUND: Fourth generation assays detect simultaneously antibodies for HIV and the p24 antigen, identifying HIV infection earlier than previous generation tests.  The status of clients on ART was additionally confirmed by fourth-generation HIV Ag/Ab combo tests, Architect and Genscreen Ultra.  INTRODUCTION: We describe the overall accuracy and performance of a serial rapid HIV testing algorithm used in community-based HIV testing in the context of a population-based household survey conducted in two sub-districts of uMgungundlovu district, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, against reference fourth-generation HIV-1/2 antibody and p24 antigen combination immunoassays.  The sample was later routinely tested with a fourth generation antigen/antibody assay as per local protocol and was strongly positive.  The fourth-generation HIV EIA was positive presumably because it detects p24 HIV antigen as well as antibodies, unlike rapid HIV tests and third-generation HIV EIAs. This case highlights not only the importance of frontline providers to understand the different testing methodologies for HIV screening and their limitations but the importance of clinical suspicion as well.  This second diagnostic window was caused by the absence of HIV specific antibodies and the decline of HIV p24 antigen concentrations below the detection limits of the fourth generation assays.  Fourth- and fifth-generation HIV assays added p24 antigen detection to the screening assay, reducing the test-negative window to 11 to 14 days.

"[SOC]###context: Clustered occurrence of multiple TFs at genomic sites may arise from chromatin accessibility and local cooperation between TFs, or binding sites may simply appear clustered if the profiles are generated from diverse cell populations.  Overlaps in TF binding profiles may also result from measurements taken at closely related time intervals.  It is thus of great interest to distinguish TFs that directly regulate gene expression from those that are indirectly associated with gene expression.  Graphical models, in particular Bayesian networks, provide a powerful mathematical framework to infer different types of dependencies.  However, existing methods do not perform well when the features (here: TF binding profiles) are highly correlated, when their association with the biological outcome is weak, and when the sample size is small.  Here, we develop a novel computational method, the Neighbourhood Consistent PC (NCPC) algorithms, which deal with these scenarios much more effectively than existing methods do.  We further present a novel graphical representation, the Direct Dependence Graph (DDGraph), to better display the complex interactions among variables.  NCPC and DDGraph can also be applied to other problems involving highly correlated biological features.  Both methods are implemented in the R package ddgraph, available as part of Bioconductor Here, we present MMDiff, a robust, broadly applicable method for detecting differences between sequence count data sets.  Based on quantifying shape changes in signal profiles, it overcomes challenges imposed by the highly structured nature of the data and the paucity of replicates Supervised detection of conserved motifs in DNA sequences with cosmo We here introduce an algorithm, called cosmo, that allows this search to be supervised by specifying a set of constraints that the position weight matrix of the unknown motif must satisfy.  Such constraints may be formulated, for example, on the basis of prior knowledge about the structure of the transcription factor in question.  The algorithm is based on the same two-component multinomial mixture model used by MEME, with stronger reliance, however, on the likelihood principle instead of more ad-hoc criteria like the E-value dPattern: transcription factor binding site (TFBS) discovery in human genome using a discriminative pattern analysis.

Effects of calcium binding and the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy A8V mutation on the dynamic equilibrium between closed and open conformations of the regulatory N-domain of isolated cardiac troponin C We also used PRE data to assess the structural effects of a familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy point mutation located within the N-domain of cTnC (A8V).   A mutation in TNNC1-encoded cardiac troponin C, TNNC1-A31S, predisposes to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and ventricular fibrillation.  Here, we report clinical and functional characterization of a novel TNNC1 mutation, A31S, identified in a pediatric HCM proband with multiple episodes of ventricular fibrillation and aborted sudden cardiac death.  In summary, we report a novel mutation in the TNNC1 gene that is associated with HCM pathogenesis and may predispose to the pathogenesis of a fatal arrhythmogenic subtype of HCM.  The objective of this work was to investigate the effect of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-linked A8V and E134D mutations in cardiac troponin C (cTnC) on the response of reconstituted thin filaments to calcium upon phosphorylation of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) by protein kinase A.  We describe a novel type of mutation (c. 363dupG) in Troponin C, a rare form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  We report the first frameshift mutation (c. 363dupG or p. Gln122AlafsX30) in Troponin C causing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (and sudden cardiac death) in a 19-year-old male, and have demonstrated that the mutation segregates with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy within the family.  One mutant (A23Q) was found with HCM-like properties (increased Ca(2+) sensitivity of force and normal levels of ATPase inhibition).  In this study, we investigated the effects of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-linked mutations A8V, E134D, and D145E in cardiac troponin C on the properties of the C-domain sites.  Recently four new hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutations in cardiac troponin C (cTnC) (A8V, C84Y, E134D, and D145E) were reported, and their effects on the Ca(2+) sensitivity of force development were evaluated Comprehensive open reading frame/splice site mutation analysis of TNNC1 performed on 1025 unrelated HCM patients enrolled over the last 10 years revealed novel missense mutations in TNNC1: A8V, C84Y, E134D, and D145E.  The cardiac troponin C (cTnC) mutation, L29Q, has been found in a patient with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  These results demonstrate that the L29Q mutation enhances the Ca(2+)-binding characteristics of cTnC and that when incorporated into cardiac myocytes, this mutant alters myocyte contractility.  Cardiac troponin C-L29Q, related to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hinders the transduction of the protein kinase A dependent phosphorylation signal from cardiac troponin I to C.  This mutation leads to a leucine-glutamine exchange at position 29 in the nonfunctional calcium-binding site of cTnC.

"[SOC]###context: Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs)--apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban--have a significantly smaller risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).  However, two facts make this situation complicated: First, the risk of hematoma expansion is unknown for NOACs.  Second, there is no specific antidote for neither of the NOACs.   However, many physicians are wary of these drugs, since there is limited evidence on how to manage bleeding in patients taking them, and since no specific antidote is known to reverse their anticoagulant effect.  Given the absence of a specific antidote, the action to be taken in these situations must be defined.   The fact that there is no specific antidote to reverse the anticoagulant action of the new anticoagulants can impair management of hemorrhagic complications; Unlike the vitamin K antagonist, i. e.  warfarin, there is no specific antidote for these medications.   The lack of guidelines, protocols, and an established specific antidote to reverse the anticoagulation effect of dabigatran potentially increases the rates of morbidity and mortality in patients with closed head injury (CHI).  The novel oral anticoagulants (NOAC) dabigatran etexilat (Pradaxa®), rivaroxaban (Xarelto®) and apixaban (Eliquis®), also known as ""direct"" anticoagulants, act independently from antithrombin by inhibiting thrombin, as in the case of dabigatran, or by inhibiting factor Xa, as in the case of rivaroxaban and apixaban.  It is assumed that they are suitable for long-term use and do not require laboratory monitoring.  Nevertheless, clinical experience is very limited and caution rather than quick conclusions is necessary.  Two major drawbacks are on the one hand the risk of drug accumulation in kidney and/or liver disease and, on the other hand, the lack of specific antidotes.   NOA also have other unresolved problems: drug interactions are still possible, specific coagulation test to assess them must be developed, and no specific antidote is currently available in case of hemorrhagic complication.   It is critical to identify and subsequently manage dabigatran etexilate toxicity because there is no specific antidote to reverse the drug's anticoagulant effects.  In the absence of a specific antidote for this novel oral anticoagulant medication, even in an emergency situation, successful surgical treatment was possible with an aggressive use of available prohaemostatic agents.  While these trial data are extremely encouraging, several practical issues (e. g. , lack of specific antidote, safety of long-term treatment or cost-effectiveness in ""real-life"" clinical practice) still need to be elucidated.  In case of massive bleeding, management is unclear and none of these newer agents has a specific antidote that completely reverses its anticoagulant effect.  The short half-life of these new agents compensates for the lack of any specific antidote in many instances.   As there is no specific antidote, the only treatment option is discontinuation of the drug and supportive management.  Currently, none of these new agents has a specific antidote, and little advise can be given on how to manage a major bleeding event.  Although there is no specific antidote to antagonise the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran, due to its short duration of effect drug discontinuation is usually sufficient to reverse any excessive anticoagulant activity.

In 1998 the US Food and Drug Administration approved thalidomide exclusively for the treatment of ENL, and strict conditions were stipulated for its use in order to prevent teratogenic adverse effects.  BACKGROUND: The use of thalidomide during the 1950s resulted in teratogenic effects in thousands of infants.  Although thalidomide is currently approved for the treatment of a complication of leprosy, it is commercially available to treat other diseases through a controlled distribution system.

"[SOC]###context: Short duration postoperative iv T(3) therapy increases cardiac index and does not alter mortality.  We conclude that although widespread interest has been shown on the use of thyroid hormones in the perioperative period, and the effect of cardiopulmonary bypass on thyroid hormone metabolism widely studied, there is no substantial evidence to justify routine use of thyroid hormones in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.  There is no clear evidence at this point to support thyroid hormone replacement in the latter patients, and it may be potentially harmful.  Rather, we hold that T3 treatment of various surgical and other patients with nonthyroidal illness should be deferred until proof of its therapeutic efficacy is demonstrated.  Perioperative administration of triiodothyronine increased cardiac output slightly and decreased systemic vascular resistance, but it had no effect on operative outcome.  Routine use after coronary surgery is thus not recommended.  Although mild effects on myocardial performance may exist, we cannot recommend at this time the routine use of intravenous T(3) as an inotropic agent in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  Raising serum triiodothyronine concentrations in patients undergoing coronary-artery bypass surgery increases cardiac output and lowers systemic vascular resistance, but does not change outcome or alter the need for standard postoperative therapy.  Thus, there seems to be no sound justification for a routine use of T3 in patients undergoing open-heart procedures.

In this case report, we used tacrolimus to successfully treat a 13-year-old boy with ocular MG who had suffered from severe steroid complications, including a failure of thrive and osteoporosis.   INTRODUCTION: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a neuromuscular disease which has been associated with an increased falls risk and glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, recognized determinants of increased fracture risk.   RESULTS: Compared to the control cohort, there was no statistically significant increased risk observed in patients with MG for any fracture (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 1. 11; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 84-1. 47) or osteoporotic fractures (AHR 0. 98 [95 % CI 0. 67-1. 41]).  Further, use of oral glucocorticoids up to a cumulative dose exceeding 5 g prednisolone equivalents did not increase risk of osteoporotic fracture (AHR 0. 99 [95 % CI, 0. 31-3. 14]) compared with MG patients without glucocorticoid exposure.  The RANKL/OPG ratio and indices of bone metabolisms are also not affected by THX, although THX increases the levels of IL-7 and RANKL.  Both disorders had been controlled for around 15 years by oral prednisolone and a cholinesterase inhibitor following surgical removal of invasive thymoma and radiotherapy, but muscular weakness due to myalgia and an increase in serum levels of myogenic enzymes, mainly ascribable to the recurrence of PM, reappeared immediately after cessation of these drugs, which was done because the patient had multiple bone fractures and severe osteoporosis due to the long-term corticosteroid therapy.   We measured bone density in 36 patients (26 females and 10 males) who had undergone long-term prednisolone administration, and found a decrease in bone density in 31% of female patients and osteoporosis in only 11. 5% (three cases).  In conclusion, prednisolone-treated patients with myasthenia gravis have an acceptable risk of bone loss if prophylactic medication is administered.

The NOMe-seq accessibility assay unexpectedly revealed symmetrical and transcription-independent nucleosomal phasing across active, poised, and inactive genomic elements.  TEPIC can be applied to various open-chromatin data, e. g.  DNaseI-seq and NOMe-seq.  Finally, these scores correctly predict known transcriptional regulators as illustrated by the application to novel DNaseI-seq and NOMe-seq data for primary human hepatocytes and CD4+ T-cells, respectively.  Recently, Methyltransferase Accessibility Protocol for individual templates-Bisulfite Genome Sequencing (MAPit-BGS) and nucleosome occupancy and methylome sequencing (NOMe-seq) have been developed for simultaneously profiling chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation on single molecules.  Here I adapted Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylome-sequencing (NOMe-seq) to measure chromatin accessibility and endogenous DNA methylation in single cells (scNOMe-seq).  Recently, Methyltransferase Accessibility Protocol for individual templates-Bisulfite Genome Sequencing (MAPit-BGS) and nucleosome occupancy and methylome sequencing (NOMe-seq) have been developed for simultaneously profiling chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation on single molecules.  We develop a statistical method, epiG, to infer and differentiate between different epi-allelic haplotypes, annotated with CpG methylation status and DNA polymorphisms, from whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data, and nucleosome occupancy from NOMe-seq data.  In this study, we make progress toward understanding these conflicting phenomena by implementing a bioinformatics approach that combines MNase-seq and NOMe-seq data and by comprehensively profiling DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy throughout the human genome.  Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylome sequencing (NOMe-seq) was used to determine the allele-specific positioning of nucleosomes around heterozygous splice site mutations in lymphoblastoid cells lines (LCLs) derived from six Lynch syndrome patients.  Here, we evaluate the scope of global epigenetic alterations at enhancers and insulator elements in prostate and breast cancer cells using simultaneous genome-wide mapping of DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy (NOMe-seq).

"[SOC]###context: All underwent surgical exploration with a laminectomy and partial resection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy to a dose of 46-50 Gy and chemotherapy with VAC (vincristine, adriamycin and cyclophosphamide) alternating with ICE (ifosphamide, cisplatin and etoposide) for at least six cycles.  For patients with localized, gross residual tumor, adding doxorubicin (DOX) to the combination of vincristine, dactinomycin, cyclophosphamide (VAC), and XRT did not significantly improve survival in 39 patients (62% alive at 10 years) compared with that of 24 patients treated with VAC and XRT without DOX (65% alive at 10 years, P = . 93).  Patients with tumors in clinical groups II, III, and IV were treated with radiotherapy (XRT) and vincristine-dactinomycin (VA) or VA plus cyclophosphamide (VAC) +/- doxorubicin.   Despite numerous molecular and biological studies during the past three decades, the chemotherapeutic regimen remains unchanged.  This vincristine, actinomycin, cyclophosphamide (VAC) regime, described in Kilman, et al.  (1973) and Koop, et al.  (1963), has achieved limited success in controlling the progression of RMS.   After the induction chemotherapy consisting of alternating vincristine, adriablastin, cyclophosphamide (VAC) and etoposide, ifosfamide with mesna protection (IE), a local treatment modality was chosen based on tumor and patient characteristics.  Induction chemotherapy consisted of two cycles of 'VAC': vincristine (V), doxorubicin (A), cyclophosphamide (C) alternated with one cycle of 'VIAc': V, ifosfamide (I), actinomycin (Ac).   Phase II studies using ifosfamide both alone and combined with vindesine and cisplatin have shown the effectiveness of this drug in patients with Ewing's sarcoma (ES) who had relapsed during VAC (vincristine, actinomycin, cyclosphosphamide)/VAd (vincristine, Adriamycin) therapy.  Phase II studies using ifosfamide both alone and combined with vindesine and cisplatin have shown the effectiveness of this drug in patients with Ewing's sarcoma (ES) who had relapsed during VAC (vincristine, actinomycin, cyclosphosphamide)/VAd (vincristine, Adriamycin) therapy.  In Novembe BACKGROUND: Based on the randomised Euro-EWING99-R1 trial, vincristine, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide (VAC) may be able to replace vincristine, adriamycin, ifosfamide (VAI) in the treatment of standard-risk Ewing sarcoma Vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) were administered to 14 patients with Ewing's sarcoma.  The pr Every patient received both types of G-CSF in different treatment courses of chemotherapy, which consisted of vincristine, ifosfamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide (VIDE); vincristine, actinomycin D, and ifosfamide (VAI); or vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide (VAC).   VAC (vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide) regimens with anthracyclines resulted in better survival.  Presence of distant metastases, large primary tumors, and pelvic localization were related to poor prognosis.  The effective treatment for sarcoma botryoides is wide excision with safe margin of 1-2 cm, followed by 6-12 cycles of vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) regiment as an adjuvant chemotherapy.   Cyclophosphamide dose escalation in combination with vincristine and actinomycin-D (VAC) in gross residual sarcoma.  A pilot study without hematopoietic growth factor support evaluating toxicity and response.  PURPOSE: The Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study (IRS) initiated an escalating-dose cyclophosphamide (Cyc) pilot without hematopoietic growth factor (HGF) support in combination with vincristine (Vcr) and actinomycin-D (Amd), known as VAC, to establish a Cyc dose with myelotoxicity comparable to an ifosfamide (Ifos), Vcr, and Amd combination regimen (VAI).  PROCEDURE: Standard chemotherapy consisted of etoposide/ifosfamide (VP16/IFOS) cycles, alternating with vincristine/dactinomycin/cyclophosphamide (VAC) cycles.   The Intergroup Study was designed to determine if the addition of adriamycin (ADR) or bilateral pulmonary radiotherapy (RT) to vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC therapy) would improve survival and reduce local recurrences and metastases.  Taking the lead from the use of vincristine, actinomycin-D, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) by Dr.  Ruth Heyn, Dr.  Harold Mauer and colleagues developed a more robust VAC as well as three similar drug regimens with hematopoietic growth factor support, which, in the context of surgery with or without radiotherapy, achieved a 3-year failure-free survival rate of 83% (IRS-IV) in nonmetastatic embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma.

Patients randomly assigned to sequential treatment received fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 75 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) (FEC-75) on day 1 of a 21-day cycle for four cycles followed by paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2) and trastuzumab 2 mg/kg (after a 4 mg/kg loading dose) once per week for 12 weeks, while those randomly assigned to the concurrent treatment group received paclitaxel and trastuzumab once per week for 12 weeks followed by four cycles of FEC-75 (on day 1 of each 21-day cycle) and once-weekly trastuzumab, in the same doses as the sequential group.  In May 2008, the patient underwent preoperative chemotherapy consisting of 4 courses of FEC 75(fluororracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide).  Stage II-IIIC HER2-positive breast cancer patients, including inflammatory disease, were treated with weekly-trastuzumab for 24 weeks administered concurrently with all primary chemotherapy containing paclitaxel (80 mg/m(2)) for 12 weeks and 4 cycles of FEC-75 (fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicine 75 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2)) followed by surgery.   Further improvements can be achieved with dose-dense regimens, but densification of fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (FEC) has proved difficult, with FEC(60) providing little benefit over standard chemotherapy and FEC(100) associated with toxicity.  We investigated the feasibility of two intermediate dose-dense FEC regimens.  Patients were randomised to six cycles of FEC(75) or FEC(90), with all three drugs given on day 1 of each 14-day cycle.   BACKGROUND: A previously published prospective randomized phase 3 trial showed that administration of 24 weeks of primary systemic chemotherapy (PST) with paclitaxel and FEC(75) (fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide) concurrently with trastuzumab in patients with HER2-positive primary breast cancer resulted in a 60% pathologic complete response rate (PCR) with no associated severe cardiac toxicity.   Maintenance chemotherapy was FEC 75 (fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 75 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) on Day 1 every 21 days for 4 cycles).   The French Epirubicin Study Group carried out a randomized trial comparing epirubicin alone 75 mg/m2 with fluorouracil (5FU) 500 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, and epirubicin 50 mg/m2 (FEC 50) and 5FU 500 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, and epirubicin 75 mg/m2 (FEC 75) as first treatment for advanced breast cancer patients.  Patients were randomised to 1 of 3 treatment groups: Group A (n = 207) received FEC 50 (fluorouracil 500 mg/m2, epirubicin 50 mg/m2 plus cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2) every 21 days for 6 cycles; Group B (n = 193) received FEC 50 every 21 days for 3 cycles; Group C (n = 195) received FEC 75 (fluorouracil 500 mg/m2, epirubicin 75 mg/m2 plus cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2) every 21 days for 3 cycles.

BACKGROUND: This study was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of a new commercially available hand sanitizer using 0. 12% benzalkonium chloride (BZK) as the active ingredient in reducing transient skin contamination with Staphylococcus aureus in health care workers (HCWs), as compared with the effectiveness of a 70% ethanol-based hand san nsumer alert issued on June 19, 2020, warning about specific hand sanitizers that contain methanol.  Whereas early clinical effects of m Methanol as an Unlisted Ingredient in Supposedly Alcohol-Based Hand Rub Can Pose Serious Health Risk d Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates alcohol-based hand sanitizers as an over-the-counter drug, methanol (methyl alcohol) is not an acceptable ingredient.  Cases of ethanol toxicity f One of the major problems after orthopedic surgery is delirium, with the largest number appearing after spine surgery. Conclusion: Hand sanitizer, mainly composed of ethanol, did not cause abnormal findings or interfere with the course of treatment of infectious spondylitis.  Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for methanol poisoning when evaluating adult or pediatric patients with reported swallowing of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer product or with symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings (e. g. , elevated anion-gap metabolic acidosis) compatible with methanol poisoning.  The purpose of this report was to present a case of ethanol-induced hand sanitizer intoxication after spine surgery in a patient with a postoperative delirious state. Presentation of case: A 63-year-old man was admitted to the spine department with intractable back pain as the main symptom and diagnosed with infectious spondylitis with discitis.  If soap and water are not readily available, CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer products that contain at least 60% ethyl alcohol (ethanol) or 70% isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol) in community settings (1); in health care settings, CDC recommendations specify that alcohol-based hand sanitizer products should contain 60%-95% alcohol (≥60% ethanol or ≥70% isopropanol) (2).  We investigated the charge generated on bedclothes (cotton and polyester) during bedding exchange with different humidities and the ignitability of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer (72. 3 mass% ethanol) due to static spark with different temperatures to identify the hazards of electrostatic shocks and ignitions occurring previously in medical facilities.  We subsequently discovered the patient had consumed half of an ethanol hand sanitizer bottle (about 300-400 mL) which was placed at the foot of the bed to prevent infection transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer is a logistically reasonable option for most circumstances, mitigating the requirement for clean running water to facilitate more traditional ""soap and water"" methods of hand disinfection.  The primary outcome was alcohol-based hand sanitizer use based on weighing bottles of hand sanitizer.  Comparison between hand sanitized fingermarks and non-hand sanitized fingermarks showed that the alcohol-based hand sanitizers did not result in any visible differences in fingermark quality.  BACKGROUND: This study was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of a new commercially available hand sanitizer using 0. 12% benzalkonium chloride (BZK) as the active ingredient in reducing transient skin contamination with Staphylococcus aureus in health care workers (HCWs), as compared with the effectiveness of a 70% ethanol-based hand sanitizer. METHODS: Fingertip touch culture plates were obtained from 40 HCWs in which all HCWs used antimicrobial soap containing 0. 6% chloroxylenol for handwashing according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for the entire study, while continuing to use the 70% ethanol-based hand sanitizer according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guideline We evaluated the virucidal efficacy of seven hand sanitizers containing various active ingredients, such as ethanol, triclosan, and chlorhexidine, and compared their effectiveness against feline calicivirus (FCV), murine norovirus (MNV), and a GII. 4 norovirus fecal extract.  Benzalkonium chloride (BAK) is a common preservative in ophthalmic medications and is the active ingredient in some skin disinfectants and hand sanitizers.  The goal here was to determine whether hand sanitizers that contain ethanol or isopropanol as the active microbicide might reduce transmission of these parasites.  Ethanol and isopropanol in concentrations present in hand sanitizers sharply reduce excystation of Giardia and Entamoeba and eliminate oral infectivity of Giardia cysts in gerbils.

INTRODUCTION: Progeria also known as Hutchinson Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) (MIM176670) is a very uncommon fatal genetic untimely aging syndrome.  Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), a rare disease that results in what appears to be premature aging, is caused by the production of a mutant form of prelamin A known as progerin.  Although children with progeria have the appearance of premature aging or senility, the term is misleading because reported cases of progeria have not manifested most physical or biochemical aspects of old age.  The Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome or progeria is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by premature aging and involvement of internal systems, such as the circulatory and locomotor.  The basic genetic defect in the Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (progeria), a premature aging syndrome, is unknown.  Progeria: a rare genetic premature ageing disorder.  Progeria is characterized by clinical features that mimic premature ageing.  Progeria is a rare fatal genetic condition characterized by an appearance of accelerated aging in children.

"[SOC]###context: Lichen sclerosus has been reported at sites of injury as a Koebner phenomenon.   Therefore, lower expression of keratinocyte-derived factors, including SCF, in vitiliginous keratinocytes, which could result from keratinocyte apoptosis, might be responsible for passive melanocyte death and may explain the Koebner phenomenon.  Deprivation of survival factors causes the apoptosis of melanocytes.  Vitiligo often develops following physical trauma, even if this is minor.  The exact mechanism of the Koebner phenomenon in vitiligo is unclear.  First described in 1877 as the appearance of psoriatic lesions in the uninvolved skin of psoriatic patients as a consequence of trauma, the Koebner phenomenon has since been described in numerous diseases.   The Koebner phenomenon is known to occur (lichen sclerosus occurs in skin already scarred or damaged), so trauma, injury, and sexual abuse have been suggested as possible triggers of symptoms in genetically predisposed people.   The triggering role of physical stress is seen in the ""deep Koebner"" phenomenon, which causes inflammation in the synovial membrane and in enthesis, resulting in peripheral arthritis.

Suicide attempts are accompanied by a willingness for death and can lead to suicide.  They are more common in high-functioning autism and Asperger subjects.   A total sample of 10 adolescents and young adults diagnosed with AS was obtained.  The high proportion of respondents with scores above the cutoff point on the overt victimization and relational victimization scales suggests that these adolescents and young adults experienced high levels of victimization.  Of the sample, 20 percent met criteria for a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, 30 percent met criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder and 50 percent had clinically significant level of suicidal ideation.  Previous studies reported a high prevalence of depression among patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and suggested a relationship between ASD and suicidality Patients with ASD had an increased risk of suicide attempts compared with those without ASD.  The suicidal behaviors are frequently observed in the adolescents and adults with an ASD without intellectual deficience.   Suicide is a major problem in Western society.  However we have very little understanding of suicidal behaviour among individuals with autism spectrum disorders.

"[SOC]###context: SGs have been linked to several pathologies including inflammatory diseases, cancer, viral infection, and neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).  Like several other ALS-associated proteins, CREST is recruited to induced stress granules.  Our data indicate that CREST and certain other ALS-linked proteins share several features implicated in ALS pathogenesis, namely the ability to aggregate, be recruited to stress granules and alter paraspeckle integrity.  A unifying feature of many proteins associated with ALS, including TDP-43 and ataxin-2, is that they localize to stress granules.   Two RNA-binding proteins, TDP-43 and FUS, aggregate in the degenerating motor neurons of ALS patients, and mutations in the genes encoding these proteins cause some forms of ALS.  Recent work connecting TDP-43 and FUS to stress granules has suggested how this cellular pathway, which involves protein aggregation as part of its normal function, might be coopted during disease pathogenesis.  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-linked fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS or FUS) is concentrated within cytoplasmic stress granules under conditions of induced stress.  Since only the mutants, but not the endogenous wild-type FUS, are associated with stress granules under most of the stress conditions reported to date, the relationship between FUS and stress granules represents a mutant-specific phenotype and thus may be of significance in mutant-induced pathogenesis.  Fused in sarcoma (FUS) belongs to the group of RNA-binding proteins implicated as underlying factors in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and certain other neurodegenerative diseases.  Multiple FUS gene mutations have been linked to hereditary forms, and aggregation of FUS protein is believed to play an important role in pathogenesis of these diseases.  In cultured cells, FUS variants with disease-associated amino acid substitutions or short deletions affecting nuclear localization signal (NLS) and causing cytoplasmic mislocalization can be sequestered into stress granules (SGs).  Profilin 1 associates with stress granules and ALS-linked mutations alter stress granule dynamics Here we report that profilin 1 and related protein profilin 2 are novel stress granule-associated proteins in mouse primary cortical neurons and in human cell lines and that ALS-linked mutations in profilin 1 alter stress granule dynamics, providing further evidence for the potential role of stress granules in ALS pathogenesis Furthermore, in response to oxidative stress or heat shock conditions in cultures and in vivo, the ALS-linked FUS mutants, but not wild-type FUS, assembled into perinuclear stress granules in proportion to their cytoplasmic expression levels.  Mutant FUS proteins that cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis incorporate into stress granules.  Our results suggest that the ALS mutations in FUS NLS can impair FUS nuclear localization, induce cytoplasmic inclusions and stress granules, and potentially perturb RNA metabolism.  RNA-binding ability of FUS regulates neurodegeneration, cytoplasmic mislocalization and incorporation into stress granules associated with FUS carrying ALS-linked mutations.  TDP-43 is an RNA-binding protein linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that is known to regulate the splicing, transport, and storage of specific mRNAs into stress granules In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) accumulates in the cytoplasm of affected neurons and glia, where it associates with stress granules (SGs) and forms large inclusions Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-linked fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS or FUS) is concentrated within cytoplasmic stress granules under conditions of induced stress Mutant FUS proteins that cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis incorporate into stress granules Mutations in Fus cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and the mutant protein forms inclusions that appear to correspond to stress granules Recent work also suggests that TDP-43 associates with cytoplasmic stress granules, which are transient structures that form in response to stress.   We found that in response to oxidative stress and to environmental insults of different types TDP-43 is capable to assemble into stress granules (SGs), ribonucleoprotein complexes where protein synthesis is temporarily arrested.   Moreover, proteins known to be stress granule markers co-deposit with inclusions in fALS and FTLD-FUS patients, implicating stress granule formation in the pathogenesis of these diseases.  We propose that two pathological hits, namely nuclear import defects and cellular stress, are involved in the pathogenesis of FUS-opathies.  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-linked fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS or FUS) is concentrated within cytoplasmic stress granules under conditions of induced stress.  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-linked FUS/TLS alters stress granule assembly and dynamics.  Moreover, proteins known to be stress granule markers co-deposit with inclusions in fALS and FTLD-FUS patients, implicating stress granule formation in the pathogenesis of these diseases.  We propose that two pathological hits, namely nuclear import defects and cellular stress, are involved in the pathogenesis of FUS-opathies.   .  Autophagy regulates amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-linked fused in sarcoma-positive stress granules in neurons However, the role of autophagy in regulation of FUS-positive stress granules (SGs) and aggregates remains unclear.   Although co-localized primarily in the nucleus in normal condition, FUS/TLS and PRMT1 were partially recruited to the cytoplasmic granules under oxidative stress, which were merged with stress granules (SGs) markers in SH-SY5Y cell.  The effect of PRMT1-mediated arginine methylation on the subcellular localization, stress granules, and detergent-insoluble aggregates of FUS/TLS Stress granules are cytoplasmic inclusions that repress translation of a subset of RNAs in times of cellular stress, and several proteins implicated in neurodegeneration (i. e.  Ataxin-2 and SMN) interact with stress granules These findings support a two-hit hypothesis, whereby cytoplasmic mislocalization of FUS protein, followed by cellular stress, contributes to the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates that may sequester FUS, disrupt RNA processing and initiate motor neuron degeneration.  Here, we exploited a Drosophila model of ALS and neuronal cell lines to elucidate the role of the RNA-binding ability of FUS in regulating FUS-mediated toxicity, cytoplasmic mislocalization and incorporation into stress granules (SGs).

"[SOC]###context: We specifically identified that the Spa homology domain (aa 250-420) of GIT1 is required for GIT1-cortactin complex localization to the leading edge.  The mechanisms involved extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2-mediated Cortactin-S405 phosphorylation and activation of Rac1/Cdc42.  We demonstrated the utility of this system with LAD constructs that can recruit the small G-protein Rac1 to the plasma membrane and induce the local formation of lamellipodia in response to focal illumination.  We found that fibroblasts from EDG-1 null embryos did not migrate toward PDGF or SPP, and inhibition of motility correlated with defective activation of the small guanosine triphosphatase Rac, which is required for lamellipodia formation and directional locomotion Deletion of edg-1 or inhibition of sphingosine kinase suppressed chemotaxis toward PDGF and also activation of the small guanosine triphosphatase Rac, which is essential for protrusion of lamellipodia and forward movement.  Evidence from these models indicates that migration is a highly complex process, which is likely to involve the tightly controlled spatial and temporal interaction of multiple factors: (v) molecules which regulate cytoskeletal function (e. g.  Rac), which allows the formation of specialized cellular processes termed lamellipodia.

"[SOC]###context: Human skin exposed to solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) results in a dramatic increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).  Studies have shown that skin exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) results in the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus altering the cellular function.   Skin exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) may induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which cause oxidative stress, DNA damage, and alteration of fibroblasts and collagen responsible for skin photoaging.  Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure causes various injurious effects to human skin by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS).  Excessive ROS production can lead to oxidative stress which may damage cellular components like lipids and proteins and causing photoaging.  Skin damage induced by UVR is an escalating problem in dermatology, and increasing incidence of skin cancer, especially for non-melanoma skin cancer, has been reported worldwide.  UVR from sun exposure and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is known to be a pivotal factor in the aetiology of skin cancer.

Congenital disorders of glycosylation form a rapidly growing group of inherited metabolic diseases.  As glycosylation affects proteins all over the organism, a mutation in a single gene leads to a multisystemic disorder.  Glycosylation is an integral part in health and disease, as emphasized by the growing number of identified glycosylation defects.  In humans, proteins are modified with a diverse range of glycoforms synthesized in complex biosynthetic pathways.  Glycosylation disorders have been described in congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) as well as in acquired disease conditions such and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).  A hallmark in a subset of CDG cases is the reduced glycosylation site occupancy of asparagine-linked glycans.   Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a growing group of inherited metabolic disorders where enzymatic defects in the formation or processing of glycolipids and/or glycoproteins lead to variety of different diseases.

"[SOC]###context: Imetelstat (a telomerase antagonist) exerts off‑target effects on the cytoskeleton.  imetelstat sodium (GRN163L), is a 13-mer oligonucleotide N3'→P5' thio-phosphoramidate lipid conjugate, which represents the latest generation of telomerase inhibitors targeting the template region of the human functional telomerase RNA (hTR) subunit.  In preclinical trials, this compound has been found to inhibit telomerase activity in multiple cancer cell lines, as well as in vivo xenograft mouse models.   In addition to the inhibition of telomerase activity in cancer cell lines, GRN163L causes morphological cell rounding changes, independent of hTR expression or telomere length.  We sought to evaluate the potential of the thio-phosphoramidate oligonucleotide inhibitor of telomerase, imetelstat, as a drug candidate for treatment of esophageal cancer.  Our results showed that imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in a dose-dependent manner in esophageal cancer cells Furthermore, long-term treatment with imetelstat decreased cell growth of esophageal cancer cells with different kinetics regarding telomere lengths  Telomerase extension is less processive during the first few weeks following the reversal of long-term treatment with the telomerase inhibitor Imetelstat (GRN163L), a time when Cajal bodies fail to deliver telomerase RNA to telomeres.  The role of telomerase as an immunotherapy, as a gene therapy approach using telomerase promoter driven oncolytic viruses and as a small oligonucleotide targeted therapy (Imetelstat) will be discussed We then tested the efficacy of the telomerase inhibitor Imetelstat on propagation and self-renewal capacity of TIC and normal stem cells in vitro and in vivo.  R e telomerase inhibitor imetelstat depletes cancer stem cells in breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines In this study, we investigated the effects of imetelstat (GRN163L), a potent telomerase inhibitor, on both the bulk cancer cells and putative CSCs.  When breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines were treated with imetelstat in vitro, telomerase activity in the bulk tumor cells and CSC subpopulations were inhibited.  Telomerase activity is required for the maintenance of normal adult stem cells, and we examined the activity of the telomerase inhibitor imetelstat against MM CSC.  Human MM CSC were isolated from cell lines and primary clinical specimens and treated with imetelstat, a specific inhibitor of the reverse transcriptase activity of telomerase.  Two weeks of exposure to imetelstat resulted in a significant reduction in telomere length and the inhibition of clonogenic MM growth both in vitro and in vivo.   Short oligonucleotide N3'-->P5' thio-phosphoramidate conjugated to 5'-palmitoyl group, designated as GRN163L (Imetelstat), was recently introduced as a potent human telomerase inhibitor etelstat (GRN163L)--telomerase-based cancer therapy.  Imetelstat (GRN163L) is a potent and specific telomerase inhibitor and so far the only drug of its class in clinical trials.  e telomerase antagonist, imetelstat, efficiently targets glioblastoma tumor-initiating cells leading to decreased proliferation and tumor growth.  The effects of a novel human telomerase antagonist, imetelstat, on primary human glioblastoma (GBM) tumor-initiating cells were investigated in vitro and in vivo.   Imetelstat treatment produced a dose-dependent inhibition of telomerase (IC(50) 0. 45 micromol/L).  Long-term imetelstat treatment led to progressive telomere shortening, reduced rates of proliferation, and eventually cell death in GBM tumor-initiating cells.   We have found that prostate TICs have significant telomerase activity which is inhibited by imetelstat sodium (GRN163L), a new telomerase antagonist that is currently in Phase I/II clinical trials for several hematological and solid tumor malignancies.  Prostate TICs telomeres were of similar average length to the telomeres of the main population of cells and significant telomere shortening was detected in prostate TICs as a result of imetelstat treatment.   Telomerase activation was countered by co-treatment with Imetelstat (GRN163L), a potent telomerase inhibitor.

Together, these results indicate that recursive splicing is commonly used in Drosophila, occurs in humans, and provides insight into the mechanisms by which some large introns are removed.  Recursive splicing in long vertebrate genes.  Moreover, the RS-sites are found in some of the longest introns across vertebrates.   The peculiarities of large intron splicing in animals.  These ""large introns"" must be spliced out of the pre-mRNA in a timely fashion, which involves bringing together distant 5' and 3' acceptor and donor splice sites.  Using a computational analysis of the genomic sequences, we show that vertebrates lack the proper enrichment of RP-sites in their large introns, and, therefore, require some other method to aid splicing Subdivision of large introns in Drosophila by recursive splicing at nonexonic elements.  Recursive splice sites predicted with highly stringent criteria are found at much higher frequency than expected in the sense strands of introns>20 kb, but they are found only at the expected frequency on the antisense strands, and they are underrepresented within introns<10 kb.  These transcripts arise by use of two alternative transcription sites and complex alternative splicing mechanisms and encode proteins with long or short N-terminal domains, complete or incomplete GGL domains, 7 distinct C-terminal domains and a common internal domain where the RGS domain is found.  These patterns of enrichment and conservation indicate that recursive splice sites are advantageous in the context of long introns.  Many genes with important roles in development and disease contain exceptionally long introns, but special mechanisms for their expression have not been investigated.  However, some long Drosophila melanogaster introns contain a cryptic site, known as a recursive splice site (RS-site), that enables a multi-step process of intron removal termed recursive splicing.  The effect of splice site strength was context-dependent and much more significant for the 3' splice site of the longer alternative intron than for the 3' splice site of the shorter alternative intron and the common 5' splice sites; it was also more significant in the rat minigene than in the mouse minigene.

"[SOC]###context: PBs are associated with mRNA decay and contain the decapping enzymes DCP1/2, the 5' to 3' exonuclease Xrn1, the Lsm proteins (1-7), and the scaffolding proteins hedls/GE-1 and GW182.  Both SGs and PBs contain mRNA, eIF4E, microRNAs and argonaute proteins, and various regulators of mRNA stability and translation (TTP, RCK/p54, and CPEB).  An alternative pathway of mRNA degradation occurs at processing bodies, cytoplasmic foci that contain decapping enzymes, the 5'-3' exonuclease Xrn1 and the Lsm1-7 heptamer.   n eukaryotic cells degradation of bulk mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction requires the consecutive action of the decapping complex (consisting of DCP1 and DCP2) and the 5' to 3' exonuclease XRN1.  These enzymes are found in discrete cytoplasmic foci known as P-bodies or GW-bodies (because of the accumulation of the GW182 antigen).  Several proteins that stimulate mRNA decapping by the Dcp1:Dcp2 complex co-localize with Dcp1 and Dcp2, together with Xrn1, a 5'-to-3' exonuclease, to structures in the cytoplasm called processing bodies.    On the other hand, many P-body components including LSM1, GW182, DDX3, DDX6 and XRN1, but not others like DCP1a and EDC4 are recruited to the viral replication sites, as evidenced by their colocalization at perinuclear region with viral NS3.

Various growth conditions, including glucose deprivation, hyperosmotic stress, and heat stress, stimulated the accumulation of P-bodies.  Here we show that microscopically visible P-bodies are greatly diminished following West Nile viral infection, but the component proteins are not depleted.  On the other hand, many P-body components including LSM1, GW182, DDX3, DDX6 and XRN1, but not others like DCP1a and EDC4 are recruited to the viral replication sites, as evidenced by their colocalization at perinuclear region with viral NS3.  Owing to the essential functions of P bodies in mRNA regulation, we explored computationally the functional significance of SNPs in 7 P body components such as XRN1, DCP2, EDC3, CPEB1, GEMIN5, STAU1 and TRIM71.  Computational analyses of non-synonymous SNPs of these components was initiated using well utilized publicly available software programs such as the SIFT, followed by PolyPhen, PANTHER, MutPred, I-Mutant-2.  Xrn1 has been shown to be a component of P-bodies (processing bodies), Here, we show that hDIS3L2 is an exosome-independent cytoplasmic mRNA 3'-5' exonuclease, which exhibits processive activity on structured RNA substrates in vitro.  hDIS3L2 associates with hXRN1 in an RNA-dependent manner and can, like hXRN1, be found on polysomes Inhibition of TAK1-JNK signaling also affected the number and size of P bodies and the localization of DCP1a, Xrn1, and Edc4.   The organizing mechanism that forms P body foci in cells is unknown; however, potential scaffolding, aggregating, or other regulatory proteins found in P bodies were investigated for degradation.  Two factors involved in 5'-end mRNA decapping and degradation, Xrn1 and Dcp1a, and the 3' deadenylase complex component Pan3 underwent accelerated degradation during infection, and Dcp1a may be a direct substrate of PV 3C proteinase.  Secondly, P-bodies recruit mRNAs that are targeted for deadenylation and degradation by the decapping/Xrn1 pathway.   Depletion of TRN increased the number of P-bodies and stabilized ARE-containing mRNAs, as observed with knockdown of the 5'-3' exonuclease Xrn1.  In this paper we show for the first time that Pacman, the Drosophila homologue of Xrn1, is localized in cytoplasmic particles in Drosophila testis cells.   Depletion of TRN increased the number of P-bodies and stabilized ARE-containing mRNAs, as observed with knockdown of the 5&apos;-3&apos; exonuclease Xrn1 These structures stain positively for a number of P-body and microRNP components, a microRNA-repressed mRNA and some translational repressors.  They appear more heterogeneous than P-bodies of HeLa cells, and they rarely contain the exonuclease Xrn1 but are positive for rRNA. 
###question: Is exonuclease Xrn1 a component of the P-bodies?[EOC] [SOR]###response: In eukaryotic cells, XRN1 is often found in particles known as processing bodies (P bodies) together with other proteins involved in the 5' → 3' degradation pathway, such as DCP2 and the helicase DHH1 (Me31B).   In yeast and human tissue culture cells, Xrn1 has been shown to be a component of P-bodies (processing bodies), dynamic cytoplasmic granules where RNA degradation can take place.  Many P-body components including LSM1, GW182, DDX3, DDX6 and XRN1, but not others like DCP1a and EDC4 are recruited to the viral replication sites, as evidenced by their colocalization at perinuclear region with viral NS3.

"[SOC]###context: One of the most common forms of pre-mRNA editing is A-to-I editing, in which adenosine is deaminated to inosine, which is read as guanosine during translation.  Deamination of adenine by adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) leads to the conversion of adenine into inosine (A-I editing) recognized by the splicing and translation systems as guanine.  denosine deaminases editing adenines in transport RNAs (ADATs) convert adenine into inosine in tRNAs of all eukaryotes; as a result, the diversity of tRNA forms in the cell increases.  A-to-I editing events in normal and cancerous human keratinocytes A-to-I RNA editing can alter codons, substitute amino acids and affect protein sequence, structure, and function.  -to-I RNA editing is a post-transcriptional mechanism frequently used to expand and diversify transcriptome and proteome repertoire in eukaryotic cells This study describes for the first time A-to-I editing in the coding sequence of a tumor suppressor gene in humans, and suggests that IGFBP7 editing serves as a fine-tuning mechanism to maintain the equilibrium between proliferation and senescence in normal skin.  Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) catalyze the adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) conversion, the most common type of RNA editing in higher eukaryotes.   RNA editing is observed in eukaryotic mRNA, transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA, and non-coding RNAs (ncRNA).  The most common RNA editing in the mammalian central nervous system is a base modification, where the adenosine residue is base-modified to inosine (A to I).

Mutations at tyrosine 641 (Y641F, Y641N, Y641S and Y641H) in the SET domain of EZH2 have been identified in patients with certain subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) The EZH2 gene was previously reported to be located on chromosome 21q22 and was proposed as a candidate gene for some characteristics of the Down syndrome phenotype Recent extensive mutation analyses of the myeloid malignancies have revealed that inactivating somatic mutations in PcG genes such as EZH2 and ASXL1 occur frequently in patients with myelodysplastic disorders including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) and MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) overlap disorders (MDS/MPN).  EZH2 is frequently overexpressed and considered to be an oncogene in cancers; nevertheless, EZH2 is considered as a candidate tumor suppressor gene in MDS due to EZH2 mutations associated with poor survival.  In 2011, mutations in the histone methyltransferase, EZH2, were shown to cause Weaver syndrome.  Among them, Sotos and Weaver syndromes are clinically well defined and due to heterozygous mutations in NSD1 and EZH2, respectively.  Weaver syndrome and EZH2 mutations: Clarifying the clinical phenotype.  Constitutional NSD1 and EZH2 mutations cause Sotos and Weaver syndromes respectively, overgrowth syndromes with considerable phenotypic overlap.  The identification of an EZH2 mutation can therefore provide an objective means of confirming a subtle presentation of Weaver syndrome and/or distinguishing Weaver and Sotos syndromes.  We postulated that mutations in writers of these two chromatin marks could cause overgrowth conditions, resembling Sotos or Weaver syndromes, in patients with no NSD1 or EZH2 abnormalities.

Somatic mutations of epigenetic gene regulators are common in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and correlate with some clinical and laboratory features.   Recently, the advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques has helped identify somatic gene mutations in 75-80% of MDS, that cluster mainly in four functional groups, i. e.  cytokine signaling (RAS genes), DNA methylation, (TET2, IDH1/2, DNMT3a genes) histone modifications (ASXL1 and EZH2 genes), and spliceosome (SF3B1 and SRSF2 genes) along with mutations of RUNX1 and TP 53 genes.

We examined the association of the age, blood pressure, clinical features, duration of symptoms and diabetes (ABCD2) score, a validated risk prediction model for stroke after TIA, and the presence of ICS or ECS.   BACKGROUND: The ABCD2 score (Age, Blood pressure, Clinical features, Duration of symptoms and Diabetes) is used to identify patients having a transient ischemic attack who are at high risk for imminent stroke.   BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The risk of stroke after a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) can be predicted by scores incorporating age, blood pressure, clinical features, duration (ABCD-score), and diabetes (ABCD2-score).   BACKGROUND: Modifications to the age, blood pressure, clinical symptoms, duration of symptoms, and diabetes (ABCD2) score, which incorporate history of hypertension and acute hyperglycemia in addition to acute blood pressure (BP) elevation and history of diabetes, have been proposed to increase the predictive value of the score.

"[SOC]###context: A diversity of cardiovascular disorders including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, congenital coronary anomalies, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, dilated cardiomyopathy, aortic rupture due to Marfan syndrome, myocarditis, valvular disease and electrical disorders (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome), as well as commotio cordis represent the common causes of SCD in young athletes.  Sudden cardiac death is the leading cause of mortality among young athletes with an incidence of 1-2 per 100,000 athletes per annum.  The majority of cases are caused by an underlying structural cardiac abnormality, most commonly hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  More recently, the understanding of non-structural causes such as long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome has grown and diagnostic criteria have been developed.   This review considers in particular the causes of death affecting athletes below 35 years of age.  In this age group the largest proportion of deaths are caused by diseases with autosomal dominant inheritance such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, long QT-syndrome, and Marfan's syndrome.   Knowledge of sudden cardiac death in young athletes is imperative for all physicians and allied health professionals.   In this article, we review several etiologies of sudden cardiac death, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and commotio cordis.   Sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young athletes is generally caused by inherited cardiac disorders.  The genetic abnormalities most associated with SCD are hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.  The most common cause of sudden cardiac death in athletes is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  Other reasons are congenital coronary artery anomalies, nivocarditis, dilatative cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy of the right ventricle, sarcoidosis, mitral valve prolapse, aortic valve stenosis, atherosclerosis, long QT syndrome, and blunt impact to the chest.  The congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is caused by cardiac ion channel mutations, which predispose young individuals to sudden cardiac death often related to exercise.   A group of relatively uncommon but important genetic cardiovascular diseases (GCVDs) are associated with increased risk for sudden cardiac death during exercise, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, long-QT syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.  Primary electrical disorders (such as the long QT syndrome) are rarely present in athletes but, so far, are a considerable reason for disqualification from sport activity.

Cell fate transitions are accompanied by global transcriptional, epigenetic and topological changes driven by transcription factors, as is exemplified by reprogramming somatic cells to pluripotent stem cells through the expression of OCT4, KLF4, SOX2 and cMYC.  How transcription factors orchestrate the complex molecular changes around their target gene loci remains incompletely understood.  Here, using KLF4 as a paradigm, we provide a transcription-factor-centric view of chromatin reorganization and its association with three-dimensional enhancer rewiring and transcriptional changes during the reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts to pluripotent stem cells.  Inducible depletion of KLF factors in PSCs caused a genome-wide decrease in enhancer connectivity, whereas disruption of individual KLF4 binding sites within pluripotent-stem-cell-specific enhancers was sufficient to impair enhancer-promoter contacts and reduce the expression of associated genes.

"[SOC]###context: Antitumor activity of saracatinib (AZD0530), a c-Src/Abl kinase inhibitor, alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents in gastric cancer.  We evaluated the antitumor effect of a c-Src/Abl kinase inhibitor, saracatinib (AZD0530), alone or combined with chemotherapeutic agents in gastric cancer cell lines and a NCI-N87 xenograft model.  Among 10 gastric cancer cell lines, saracatinib specifically inhibited the growth and migration/invasion of SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells.  Saracatinib blocked the Src/FAK, HER family, and oncogenic signaling pathways, and it induced G(1) arrest and apoptosis in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells.   Consistent with our in vitro findings, cotreatment with saracatinib and 5-FU resulted in enhanced antitumor activity in the NCI-N87 xenografts.  These data indicate that the inhibition of Src kinase activity by saracatinib alone or in combination with other agents can be a strategy to target gastric cancer.

"[SOC]###context:  Here we describe the clinical case of a female patient with Prader Willi Syndrome (PWS), a genomic imprinting disorder Perturbation of the allelic DNA methylation at ICRs is causally involved in several human diseases, including the Beckwith-Wiedemann and Silver-Russell syndromes, associated with aberrant foetal growth.  Perturbed imprinted gene expression is also implicated in the neuro-developmental disorders Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome.  This epigenetic ""life cycle"" of imprinting (germline erasure, germline establishment, and somatic maintenance) can be disrupted in several human diseases, including Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), Angelman syndrome and Hydatidiform mole.  In the neurodevelopmental Rett syndrome, the way the ICR mediates imprinted expression is perturbed.  eregulation of imprinted genes has been observed in a number of human diseases as gestation trophoblastic disease, Prader-Willi, Angelmann and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes and plays significant role in the carcinogenesis.  Angelman's syndrome families, which are known to be imprinted.   Deregulation of imprinted genes has been observed in a number of human diseases such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Prader-Willi/Angelman syndromes and cancer.  Genomic imprinting is the phenomenon whereby some genes preferentially produce mRNA transcripts from the gene copy derived from the parent of a specific sex.  It has been implicated in a number of human diseases (most of them of endocrine interest), such as Prader-Willi/Angelman syndromes, Silver-Russell syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, transient neonatal diabetes, the focal form of nesidioblastosis, and pseudohypoparathyroidism.  imprinting disorders like Beckwith-Wiedemann and Prader-Willi/Angelman syndromes It is particularly interesting from the clinical point of view that a number of human diseases, such as the Beckwith-Wiedemann and Prader-Willi/Angelman syndromes, appear to involve unbalanced parental contributions of imprinted loci.   Examples include the Prader-Willi, Angelman, and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndromes [Nicholls (1994): Am J Hum Genet 54:733-740], malignancy [Sapienza (1990): Biochim Biophys Acta 1072:51-61; Feinberg (1993): Nat Genet 4:110-113], and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) [Julier et al.

"[SOC]###context: Adverse experiences included nausea, dizziness, and insomnia.  Side effects to nalmefene were of greater duration and intensity in the subjects receiving 10 mg of nalmefene vs.  those receiving 6 or 2 mg.  These included most notably fatigue, lightheadedness, nausea and vomiting.  The nalmefene treated group ate 22% less, both in terms of absolute weight and caloric intake, of a standardised buffet-meal than did the placebo group.   Thus the apparent nutrient specificity of nalmefene appeared to be an indirect consequence of its effect on palatability.  Nalmefene also caused slight increases in self-rated alertness, and decreases in ratings of tiredness and elation, although it was thought unlikely that these accounted for observed changes in eating behaviour.  In the second study, six healthy men were initially administered a single 50-mg dose of drug, and plasma samples were obtained at selected time intervals for 48 hours.  A dosing schedule of 20 mg q12h was then started and continued for seven days.  Plasma samples were collected immediately before each dose and at selected times for up to 48 hours after the last dose.  The drug was well tolerated by all subjects, and no clinically significant adverse effects were observed during the seven-day administration period.   In the first study, single ascending doses of 50, 100, 200, and 300 mg of nalmefene HCl were administered in double-blind fashion to four groups of healthy men.  There were six subjects in each group; four received nalmefene and two received placebo.  The drug was well tolerated at all dose levels with only mild and transient side effects, such as lightheadedness, at the higher doses.   Doses of nalmefene as large as 0. 4 mg/kg, IV, produced only minor side effects.  These side effects included some passage of semifluid fecal material, intermittent penile relaxation, and mild sedation.  Treated horses responded normally to external stimuli, retained their appetites, and performed appropriately when ridden.  Sedation wore off during the course of prolonged infusions.   The drug was well tolerated at all dose levels with only mild and transient side effects, the most common of which was lightheadedness.

"[SOC]###context: Synthesis of the modified thymine base, beta-d-glucosyl-hydroxymethyluracil or J, within telomeric DNA of Trypanosoma brucei correlates with the bloodstream form specific epigenetic silencing of telomeric variant surface glycoprotein genes involved in antigenic variation.   We have recently proposed a model in which chromatin remodeling by a SWI2/SNF2-like protein (JBP2) regulates the developmental and de novo site-specific localization of J synthesis within bloodstream form trypanosome DNA.  JBP1 and JBP2 are two distinct thymidine hydroxylases involved in J biosynthesis in genomic DNA of African trypanosomes.  The base is synthesized in a two-step pathway.  Initially, a thymidine residue in DNA is hydroxylated by a thymidine hydroxylase (TH).  This intermediate (HOMedU) is then glucosylated to form base J.  Two proteins involved in J synthesis, JBP1 (J binding protein 1) and JBP2, contain a putative TH domain related to the family of Fe(2+)/2-oxoglutarate-dependent hydroxylases.  Here we show that mutation of key residues in the TH domain of JBP2 ablate its ability to induce de novo J synthesis.    We conclude that JBP2 and JBP1 are the TH enzymes involved in J biosynthesis.  Two thymidine hydroxylases differentially regulate the formation of glucosylated DNA at regions flanking polymerase II polycistronic transcription units throughout the genome of Trypanosoma brucei.  We have previously characterized two thymidine-hydroxylases (TH), JBP1 and JBP2, which regulate J-biosynthesis.  JBP2 is a chromatin re-modeling protein that induces de novo J-synthesis, allowing JBP1, a J-DNA binding protein, to stimulate additional J-synthesis.  JBP2 and JBP1 are capable of stimulating de novo J-synthesis.  Chromosome-internal J deposition is primarily mediated by JBP1, whereas JBP2-stimulated J deposition at the telomeric regions.   β-d-glucopyranosyloxymethyluracil (base J) synthesis is initiated by the JBP1/2 enzymes that hydroxylate thymine, forming 5-hydroxymethyluracil (hmU) A recent computational screen identified a possible candidate for the base J-associated glucosyltransferase (JGT) in trypanosomatid genomes.  Here we discuss the regulation of hmU and base J formation in the trypanosome genome by JGT and base J-binding protein.  The thymidine hydroxylases (JPB1 and JBP2) that catalyze the first step have been characterized, but the identity of the glucosyltransferase catalyzing the second step has proven elusive.    The deletion of both alleles of JGT from the genome of Trypanosoma brucei generates a cell line that completely lacks base J The deletion of both alleles of JGT from the genome of Trypanosoma brucei generates a cell line that completely lacks base J.  β-d-glucopyranosyloxymethyluracil (base J) synthesis is initiated by the JBP1/2 enzymes that hydroxylate thymine, forming 5-hydroxymethyluracil (hmU).

"[SOC]###context: HUWE1 is a critical colonic tumour suppressor gene that prevents MYC signalling, DNA damage accumulation and tumour initiation.  To determine the importance of HUWE1, we chose to examine its function in colorectal cancer, where it is mutated in up to 15 per cent of tumours.  Modelling of identified mutations showed that they inactivate the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of HUWE1.  Genetic deletion of Huwe1 rapidly accelerated tumourigenic in mice carrying loss of the intestinal tumour suppressor gene Apc, with a dramatic increase in tumour initiation.  Mechanistically, this phenotype was driven by increased MYC and rapid DNA damage accumulation leading to loss of the second copy of Apc The increased levels of DNA damage sensitised Huwe1-deficient tumours to DNA-damaging agents and to deletion of the anti-apoptotic protein MCL1.  Taken together, these data identify HUWE1 as a bona fide tumour suppressor gene in the intestinal epithelium and suggest a potential vulnerability of HUWE1-mutated tumours to DNA-damaging agents and inhibitors of anti-apoptotic proteins.

"[SOC]###context: The telomerase inhibitor imetelstat alone, and in combination with trastuzumab, decreases the cancer stem cell population and self-renewal of HER2+ breast cancer cells.  The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a telomerase antagonistic oligonucleotide, imetelstat (GRN163L), on CSC and non-CSC populations of HER2(+) breast cancer cell lines.  Imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in both subpopulations.   Telomerase inhibitor Imetelstat (GRN163L) limits the lifespan of human pancreatic cancer cells.  GRN163L (Imetelstat) is a lipid-conjugated N3'→P5' thio-phosphoramidate oligonucleotide that blocks the template region of telomerase.   We evaluated the effect of the telomerase inhibitor imetelstat in preclinical models of MRT.   Treatment with imetelstat resulted in inhibition of telomerase activity, marked telomere shortening, and activation of the DNA damage response pathway, as measured by formation of γ-H2AX nuclear foci, phosphorylation of ATM, and phosphorylation of TP53.  The activity of imetelstat as a single agent suggests that further studies of telomerase inhibitors in combination with other agents may be warranted.   Imetelstat, a phase 2 telomerase inhibitor, was used to elucidate the effect of telomerase inhibition on proliferation and tumorigenicity in established cell lines (BXD-1425EPN, R254), a primary TIC line (E520) and xenograft models of pediatric ependymoma.   PURPOSE: Imetelstat is a covalently-lipidated 13-mer thiophosphoramidate oligonucleotide that acts as a potent specific inhibitor of telomerase.   Imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in both subpopulations.  Imetelstat inhibited proliferation and self-renewal by shortening telomeres and inducing senescence in vitro.  Our results showed that imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in a dose-dependent manner in esophageal cancer cells.  When breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines were treated with imetelstat in vitro, telomerase activity in the bulk tumor cells and CSC subpopulations were inhibited.  Differences between telomerase activity expression levels or telomere length of CSCs and bulk tumor cells in these cell lines did not correlate with the increased sensitivity of CSCs to imetelstat, suggesting a mechanism of action independent of telomere shortening for the effects of imetelstat on the CSC subpopulations.  Imetelstat (a telomerase antagonist) exerts off‑target effects on the cytoskeleton.  The GBM tumor-initiating cells were treated with imetelstat and examined for the effects on telomerase activity levels, telomere length, proliferation, clonogenicity, and differentiation.  We evaluated the effect of the telomerase inhibitor imetelstat in preclinical models of MRT.  This enzyme is expressed in approximately 90% of human tumors, but not in the majority of normal somatic cells.  imetelstat sodium (GRN163L), is a 13-mer oligonucleotide N3'→P5' thio-phosphoramidate lipid conjugate, which represents the latest generation of telomerase inhibitors targeting the template region of the human functional telomerase RNA (hTR) subunit.   Telomerase antagonist imetelstat inhibits esophageal cancer cell growth and increases radiation-induced DNA breaks.  Our results suggest that imetelstat-mediated depletion of CSCs may offer an alternative mechanism by which telomerase inhibition may be exploited for cancer therapy.  Imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in both subpopulations.  Moreover, imetelstat alone and in combination with trastuzumab reduced the CSC fraction and inhibited CSC functional ability, as shown by decreased mammosphere counts and invasive potential.   When breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines were treated with imetelstat in vitro, telomerase activity in the bulk tumor cells and CSC subpopulations were inhibited.   Our results showed that imetelstat inhibited telomerase activity in a dose-dependent manner in esophageal cancer cells.   Telomerase Inhibitor Imetelstat in Patients with Essential Thrombocythemia.  The telomerase inhibitor imetelstat depletes cancer stem cells in breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines.  A Pilot Study of the Telomerase Inhibitor Imetelstat for Myelofibrosis.  We sought to evaluate the potential of the thio-phosphoramidate oligonucleotide inhibitor of telomerase, imetelstat, as a drug candidate for treatment of esophageal cancer.   In this study, we investigated the effects of imetelstat (GRN163L), a potent telomerase inhibitor, on both the bulk cancer cells and putative CSCs.   Differences between telomerase activity expression levels or telomere length of CSCs and bulk tumor cells in these cell lines did not correlate with the increased sensitivity of CSCs to imetelstat, suggesting a mechanism of action independent of telomere shortening for the effects of imetelstat on the CSC subpopulations.   BACKGROUND: Imetelstat, a 13-mer oligonucleotide that is covalently modified with lipid extensions, competitively inhibits telomerase enzymatic activity.   Imetelstat is a 13-mer lipid-conjugated oligonucleotide that targets the RNA template of human telomerase reverse transcriptase. METHODS: We sought to obtain preliminary information on the therapeutic activity and safety of imetelstat in patients with high-risk or intermediate-2-risk myelofibrosis.   Telomerase is reactivated in tumor cells, including CSCs, but has limited activity in normal tissues, providing potential for telomerase inhibition in anti-cancer therapy.

"[SOC]###context: α-Synuclein is the major protein associated with Lewy body dementia, Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy.  With the aim to develop antibodies showing high specificity and sensitivity for disease-associated α-synuclein, synthetic peptides containing different amino acid sequences were used for immunization of mice.  Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies are very frequent neurological disorders of the elderly.  Mutations in the alpha-synuclein (alphaSYN) gene cause Parkinson's disease, often associated with dementia.  Neuropathologically these diseases are characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, intraneuronal inclusions mostly composed of alphaSYN protein fibrils.  Immunohistochemistry for alpha-synuclein revealed LBs in 31 of 290 PSP cases (11%).  We immunohistochemically investigated the degeneration processes of the nigro-striatal and nigro-amygdaloid pathways and the relationship between the loss of dopaminergic neurons and Lewy bodies (LB) formation in the substantia nigra using 15 autopsied cases of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).  The substantia nigra possessed alpha-synuclein-positive LB-bearing neurons that were almost evenly distributed, while the putamen exhibited diffuse or granular alpha-synuclein-immunostaining.  The major protein constituent of Lewy bodies (LBs), the pathological hallmark of Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, is considered to be alpha-synuclein, Recently, alpha-synuclein (alphaS) has been found to be a central constituent of LB.  By having the antibody AFshp raised specifically to alpha-synuclein to label Parkinson disease-specific Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites as well as synaptic boutons containing the unaltered protein, an initial attempt is made to map the overall distribution pattern and describe the staining behavior of the immunoreactive punctae in select regions of the prosencephalon.  Notably, carboxy-terminal alpha-syn epitopes were immunodominant in GCIs, but the entire panel of antibodies immunostained cortical Lewy bodies (LBs) in dementia with LBs brain with similar intensity.  Discrete immunostaining was demonstrated in NFTs and neuropil threads with various antibodies against phosphorylated tau, and in LBs with antibody against alpha-synuclein.  The identification of the alpha-synuclein gene on chromosome 4q as a locus for familial Lewy-body parkinsonism and of alpha-synuclein as a component of Lewy bodies has heralded a new era in the study of Parkinson's disease.  Alpha-synuclein cortical Lewy bodies correlate with dementia in Parkinson's disease recent advances in immunostaining of alpha-synuclein have suggested the possible importance of cortical Lewy bodies (CLBs) in the brains of demented patients with PD.  CLBs positive for alpha-synuclein are highly sensitive (91%) and specific (90%) neuropathologic markers of dementia in PD CLBs detected by alpha-synuclein antibodies in patients with PD are a more sensitive and specific correlate of dementia alpha-Synuclein immunoreactivity in dementia with Lewy bodies alpha-Synuclein is a presynaptic protein recently identified as a specific component of Lewy bodies (LB) and Lewy neurites.  alpha-Synuclein immunostaining was more specific than ubiquitin immunostaining in that it differentiated LB from globose tangles.  The precursor of the non-Abeta component of Alzheimer's disease amyloid (NACP) (also known as alpha-synuclein) is a presynaptic terminal molecule that abnormally accumulates in the plaques of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and in the Lewy bodies (LBs) of Lewy body variant of AD, diffuse Lewy body disease, and Parkinson's disease.  To better understand the distribution of NACP/alpha-synuclein and its fragments in the LB-bearing neurons and neurites, as well as to clarify the patterns of NACP/alpha-synuclein compartmentalization, we studied NACP/alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity using antibodies against the C-terminal, N-terminal, and NAC regions after Proteinase K and formic acid treatment in the cortex of patients with LBs.  Ultrastructural analysis revealed that NACP/alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity was diffusely distributed within the amorphous electrodense material in the LBs and as small clusters in the filaments of LBs and neurites.  These results support the view that aggregated NACP/alpha-synuclein might play an important role in the pathogenesis of disorders associated with LBs.  Nigral and cortical Lewy bodies and dystrophic nigral neurites in Parkinson's disease and cortical Lewy body disease contain alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity PD brain demonstrated alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity in nigral Lewy bodies, pale bodies and abnormal neurites.  DLB cases demonstrated these findings as well as alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity in cortical Lewy bodies and CA2-3 neurites.  These results suggest that, even in sporadic cases, there is an early and direct role for alpha-synuclein in the pathogenesis of PD and the neuropathologically related disorder DLB.

"[SOC]###context: A new gut-specific monoclonal antibody, vedolizumab, has been shown to be effective in inflammatory bowel disease, and in continued trials no patients have developed PML.   Finally, several studies were presented on new drugs with new therapeutic targets, such as vedolizumab, in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.   We review the role of vedolizumab, a humanized antibody against the α4β7 - integrin, in both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD).  Results from clinical trials show that vedolizumab is effective in the induction and maintenance of remission in active CD and UC and has a very good safety profile.  Vedolizumab as induction and maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease.  NCLUSIONS: Vedolizumab-treated patients with active Crohn's disease were more likely than patients receiving placebo to have a remission, but not a CDAI-100 response, at week 6; patients with a response to induction therapy who continued to receive vedolizumab (rather than switching to placebo) were more likely to be in remission at week 52.   Vedolizumab as induction and maintenance therapy for ulcerative colitis.  CONCLUSIONS: Vedolizumab was more effective than placebo as induction and maintenance therapy for ulcerative colitis.  New and emerging treatments for ulcerative colitis: a focus on vedolizumab.   This article reviews the emerging data on the use of vedolizumab for UC.    Newer treatments such as vedolizumab and tofacitinib may represent valuable future therapies.  SUMMARY: New therapeutic targets in IBD patients who failed anti-TNF-α therapy are urgently required, and tofacitinib, vedolizumab and ustekinumab appear to be the most promising drugs.   BACKGROUND: Vedolizumab, a gut-selective, anti-inflammatory monoclonal antibody, has shown preliminary efficacy in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD).   CONCLUSION: Vedolizumab every 8 weeks for up to 78 weeks had an adverse event profile similar to that previously observed.  Mean disease activity indices (partial Mayo score and Crohn's Disease Activity Index score) improved with all 3 doses investigated.  The new drugs discussed here are those that disturb lymphocyte homing to the gut (natalizumab, vedolizumab and anti-mucosal addressin cellular adhesion molecule); one that blocks interleukin (IL)-12 as well as the IL-23/T helper 17 (Th17) axis (ustekinumab) and one that blocks the signaling of multiple cytokines (tofacitinib).  Vedolizumab  for Crohn's disease.  AREAS COVERED: This review discusses the potential role of vedolizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody that selectively blocks lymphocyte trafficking to the gut, for the treatment of CD.  All randomised placebo-controlled trials that evaluated vedolizumab for the treatment of CD were reviewed and safety and efficacy data evaluated.  EXPERT OPINION: Vedolizumab is an effective and well-tolerated drug that is an important advance for the treatment of CD.  Treatment strategies that appear particularly appealing include selective anti-integrin therapy with vedolizumab (anti-α4β7), etrolizumab (anti-β7 antibody) and PF-00547,659 (anti-MAdCAM-1 antibody), anti-interleukin 12/23p40 therapy with ustekinumab and Janus kinase 1, 2 and 3 inhibition with toafacitinib.  We discuss a number of them with specific focus on vedolizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the alpha4beta7 integrin on lymphocytes, ustekinumab, a monoclonal antibody against the p40 subunit of interleukin-12 and interleukin-23, and tofacitinib, a small molecule targeting Janus-activated kinase.  Most likely, these three agents will find their way to the market and offer significant therapeutic alternatives for the management of Crohn's disease and/or ulcerative colitis.  Natalizumab, vedolizumab, alicaforsen AJM300, rhuMAb β7, CCX282-B, and PF-00547,659 are few of monoclonal antibodies that have shown high promise in trials with the potential for more attractive benefit:risk ratio than currently available therapies.  Vedolizumab for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.  Here, we discuss the current treatment options available for patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, the history of CAM inhibitors, the current state of development of vedolizumab and its future role in inflammatory bowel disease, if approved by regulatory agencies.  Biological agents will probably be used earlier and more widely; new information on levels of biological agents, mucosal healing and new comparative studies will also allow these agents to be used in a more precise and personalized way.  In addition to infliximab, adalimumab, natalizumab and certolizumab, other biological agents will be employed; among the first of these to be used will be ustekinumab, golimumab and vedolizumab.  Several antibodies exist which constitute selection adhesion molecule inhibitors, including Natalizumab, MLN-0002 (Vedolizumab) and ISIS 2302 (Alicaforsen) will be discussed in this review.

BACKGROUND: Vedolizumab is a gut-selective biologic that has shown efficacy in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD).  They are anti CD4+ T cell cytokine including interleukin (IL)-12/23 and IL-17 blockers, selective anti-adhesion molecule known as natalizumab, vedolizumab and alicaforsen, T-cell proliferation inhibitor, anti-inflammatory cytokine, immune stimulator, growth factor, and mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor.   Vedolizumab, a humanized mAb against the α4β7 integrin for the potential treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.  Data from phase II clinical trials of vedolizumab demonstrated efficacy with an attractive safety profile, especially in ulcerative colitis.  Large phase III, multicenter trials in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease will provide valuable data for the ongoing development of vedolizumab, which might evolve as a new anti-inflammatory treatment option for the management of therapy-refractory patients.  The development of a new specific molecule, vedolizumab, is currently under investigation in a large clinical trial.  This novel specific anti-integrin drug seems to hold promise in the treatment of gut inflammation.  The binding specificity and selective antagonism of vedolizumab, an anti-alpha4beta7 integrin therapeutic antibody in development for inflammatory bowel diseases.  These pharmacologic properties of vedolizumab, in conjunction with the gastrointestinal tropism of alpha(4)beta(7) integrin function, may ultimately confer an improved risk-to-benefit profile for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.  In the Crohn's disease study that included maintenance treatment, vedolizumab was significantly more effective at 52 weeks than placebo in both endpoints (clinical remission was the only primary endpoint in the maintenance study) Vedolizumab is a useful addition to the treatment options available for patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease Vedolizumab-treated patients with active Crohn's disease were more likely than patients receiving placebo to have a remission, but not a CDAI-100 response, at week 6; patients with a response to induction therapy who continued to receive vedolizumab (rather than switching to placebo) were more likely to be in remission at week 52
###question: List the diseases that can be treated using Vedolizumab. [EOC] [SOR]###response: Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are inflammatory bowel diseases that have been successfully treated with Vedolizumab, a gut-selective, anti-inflammatory monoclonal antibody. [EOR]"
"[SOC]###context: miRNAs are aberrantly expressed in AD, and these have been implicated in the regulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, tau, inflammation, cell death, and other aspects which are the main pathomechanisms of AD.  In addition, regulation of miRNAs varies in blood, and cerebral spinal fluid may indicate alterations in AD.  miRNA microarray analysis was carried out on blood of rats at 1 week and 2 months after injection.  RESULTS: Many up- and downregulated miRNAs were detected.  Blood miRNAs could be useful as biomarkers for exposure to nanoparticles.  miR-298 regulates β-amyloid (Aβ) precursor protein-converting enzyme-1 (BACE1) in Alzheimer's disease.   We previously studied microRNAs (miRNAs) in AD autopsy brain samples and reported a connection between miR-137, -181c, -9, -29a/b and AD, through the regulation of ceramides.  In this study, the potential role of these miRNAs as diagnostic markers for AD was investigated.  We identified that these miRNAs were down-regulated in the blood serum of probable AD patients.   287 with Alzheimer disease (AD) as compared with 344 age- and gender-matched controls.  In addition, we evaluated expression levels of hnRNP-A1 and its regulatory microRNA (miR)-590-3p in blood cells from patients and controls.  Decreased relative expression levels of hsa-miR-590-3p was observed in patients with AD versus controls (0. 685 ± 0. 080 versus 0. 931 ± 0. 111, p = 0. 079), and correlated negatively with hnRNP-A1 mRNA levels (r = -0. 615, p = 0. 0237).  expression analysis of Sp1 and its regulatory microRNAs (hsa-miR-29b and hsa-miR-375) has been performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), together with Sp1 protein analysis.  Significantly decreased relative expression levels of hsa-miR-29b, but not of hsa-miR-375, were observed in AD patients Sp1 and its regulatory hsa-miR-29b are deregulated in AD patients, possibly leading to aberrant production of downstream target genes involved in the pathogenesis.   We previously observed that miR-137, -181c, -9, and 29a/b post-transcriptionally regulate SPT levels, and the corresponding miRNA levels in the blood sera are potential diagnostic biomarkers for AD.  Here, we observe a negative correlation between cortical Aβ42 and sera Aβ42, and a positive correlation between cortical miRNA levels and sera miRNA levels suggesting their potential as noninvasive diagnostic biomarkers. 
###question: Can Alzheimer's disease related miRNAs be detected in patients' blood?[EOC] [SOR]###response: Yes.  It has been demonstrated that blood miRNAs could be useful as biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease. [EOR]"
"[SOC]###context: While detailed histological subtyping remains the best independent predictor of aggressive behavior in the majority of cases, evidence suggests that the additional analyses of FGFR4, MMP, PTTG, Ki-67, p53, and deletions in chromosome 11 may contribute to decisions concerning management of aggressive pituitary adenomas.  We observed elevation of MMP-2 and -9 expression and consequent 3-D cell invasion in cells under-expressing RECK.    Based on the significance of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) for tumor growth and angiogenesis, we have studied the effect of batimastat (BB-94), a synthetic MMPs inhibitor (MMPI) on the progression of prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma in rats.   Inhibition of estrogen-induced pituitary tumor growth and angiogenesis in Fischer 344 rats by the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor batimastat.  The results of our study provide evidence for an inhibitory effect of batimastat, a synthetic MMPI, on the growth and angiogenesis in an experimental model of human prolactinoma.  In summary, the differential expression of extracellular matrix components, integrins and matrix metalloproteinase contributes to the control of pituitary hormone production and cell proliferation during tumorigenesis.  Data on the dural invasiveness of pituitary adenomas have been correlated to the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (e. g.  MMP-9).   We found no correlation of MMP-9 expression and tumour invasion.  The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their nature inhibitors-the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) may play a central role in these processes.  CONCLUSIONS: TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 may play a key role in invasive pituitary adenomas to biological behavior.  The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-containing endopeptidases that are able to degrade the extracellular matrix and allow angiogenesis and tumor invasion.   MMP-9 expression did not differ between noninvasive tumors and normal pituitary gland, or between different sized prolactinomas.  MMP-9 expression was related to aggressive tumor behavior.  It was higher in invasive macroprolactinomas (P = 0. 003) when compared with noninvasive macroprolactinomas or the normal anterior pituitary gland.  In addition, although there was no difference in whether MMP-9 was present or not when nonfunctioning adenomas that recurred were compared with those that did not, samples of recurrent tumor at the second presentation were more likely to express MMP-9 (P = 0. 01).  Pituitary carcinomas were significantly more likely to be MMP-9 positive compared with normal anterior pituitary gland (P = 0. 05), but there was no difference from invasive adenomas.  Angiogenesis assessed by vascular density was related to MMP-9 expression (P<0. 05).  In summary, we have shown the presence of MMP-9 expression in some invasive and recurrent pituitary adenomas, and in the majority of pituitary carcinoma.  The mechanisms whereby MMP-9 expression influences tumor recurrence and invasiveness, and its association with angiogenesis, remains to be elucidated.   Beside the digestion of the extracellular matrix during tumor invasion and metastasis, more recently, new functions for matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been proposed.   CONCLUSION: No correlation could be established between the invasive potential of tumors and MMP-1, -2, and -3 expression levels.   Matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 expression correlated with cavernous sinus invasion of pituitary adenomas.  Data on the dural invasiveness of pituitary adenomas have been correlated to the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (e. g.  We found surprisingly high levels of MMP activity and low levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, indicating a high level of extracellular matrix-degrading activity in pituitary adenomas.  The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their nature inhibitors-the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) may play a central role in these processes.   We found surprisingly high levels of MMP activity and low levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, indicating a high level of extracellular matrix-degrading activity in pituitary adenomas.  There was an association between the invasion of pituitary adenomas and Ki-67 LI (P = 0. 039) or the expression of VEGF (P &lt; 0. 001) and MMP-9 (P &lt; 0. 001).  But c-myc LI and bcl-2 expression have no association with invasiveness of pituitary adenomas (P = 0. 061 vs.  nm23 and MMP-9 have associations with invasiveness of pituitary adenomas, Matrix metalloproteinase secreted by pituitary cells can release growth factors from the extracellular matrix that, in turn, control pituitary cell proliferation and hormone secretion.  In summary, the differential expression of extracellular matrix components, integrins and matrix metalloproteinase contributes to the control of pituitary hormone production and cell proliferation during tumorigenesis.  There was an association between the invasion of pituitary adenomas and Ki-67 LI (P = 0. 039) or the expression of VEGF (P &lt; 0. 001) and MMP-9 (P &lt; 0. 001).  Although our study has shown that MVD and the expression of VEGF, Ki-67, nm23 and MMP-9 have associations with invasiveness of pituitary adenomas, they are lack of specificity. 
###question: Is there association of matrix metalloproteinases with behaviour of pituitary adenomas?[EOC] [SOR]###response: Yes, there is evidence to suggest that matrix metalloproteinases are associated with more aggressive of pituitary adenomas. [EOR]"

"[SOC]###context: In this study, we demonstrated that the HSV-1 UL42 protein, a DNA polymerase processivity factor, was a novel antagonism of the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway.  UL42 was shown to significantly suppress TNF-α mediated NF-κB activation.  Co-immunoprecipitation experiment revealed that UL42 bound to the NF-κB subunits p65 and p50.   Thus, it was first time we demonstrated that HSV-1 UL42 appeared to prevent NF-κB-dependent gene expression by retaining p65 and p50 in the cytoplasm, and UL42-dependent transcriptional activation were inherently coupled to promote HSV-1 lytic replication, which also may contribute to immune evasion and pathogenesis of HSV-1.  The review describes NF-κB and its two pathways: the canonical, mediated by the p65 and p50 subunits, and the non-canonical, mediated by the subunits RelB, p52 and p50.   The function of the TTV open reading frame (ORF) in the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway has not yet been established.  In this study, we found for the first time that the TTV ORF2 protein could suppress NF-kappaB activity in a dose-dependent manner in the canonical NF-kappaB pathway.  By Western blot analysis, we proved that the TTV ORF2 protein did not alter the level of NF-kappaB expression but prevented the p50 and p65 subunits from entering the nucleus due to the inhibition of IkappaBalpha protein degradation.  Herpes simplex virus 1 DNA polymerase processivity factor UL42 inhibits TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation by interacting with p65/RelA and p50/NF-κB1.

"[SOC]###context: Evidence of reduced recombination rate in human regulatory domains.  We study the relationship between recombination rate and gene regulatory domains, defined by a gene and its linked control elements.  We define these links using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs), chromatin conformation from publicly available datasets (Hi-C and ChIA-PET), and correlated activity links that we infer across cell types.  Each link type shows a ""recombination rate valley"" of significantly reduced recombination rate compared to matched control regions.  This recombination rate valley is most pronounced for gene regulatory domains of early embryonic development genes, housekeeping genes, and constitutive regulatory elements, which are known to show increased evolutionary constraint across species.  Recombination rate valleys show increased DNA methylation, reduced doublestranded break initiation, and increased repair efficiency, specifically in the lineage leading to the germ line.  Moreover, by using only the overlap of functional links and DNA methylation in germ cells, we are able to predict the recombination rate with high accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the existence of a recombination rate valley at regulatory domains and provide a potential molecular mechanism to interpret the interplay between genetic and epigenetic variations.

"[SOC]###context: Consistent with a genetic hypothesis for CMI, much of the PF morphology was found to be heritable and multiple genomic regions were strongly implicated from OSA, including regions on Chromosomes 1 (LOD = 3. 07, p = 3 × 10(-3) ) and 22 (LOD = 3. 45, p = 6 × 10(-5) ) containing several candidates warranting further investigation.  Furthermore, we report the first case of documented Arnold-Chiari malformation type I and increased factor XIII activity associated with 6p trisomy.   Of particular interest were two regions (Chr8, Max LOD = 3. 04; Chr12, Max LOD = 2. 09) identified within the subset of ""CTD-negative"" families, both of which harbor growth differentiation factors (GDF6, GDF3) implicated in the development of Klippel-Feil syndrome (KFS).  Moreover, the performed DNA analysis showed interstitial duplication in chromosome 5 (5q35. 1).   CGH microarray showed a approximately 520. 7 kb microdeletion on 16p13. 3 involving CREBBP, ADCY9, and SRL genes.

Multipoint LOD scores on chromosome 9 maximized at 3. 05, identifying a 40 cM region with LOD scores over 1 (9q21. 33-33. 1) and a tighter region with multipoint LOD scores over 2 that was only 8. 5 cM.   In addition, this child had an Arnold-Chiari type I malformation that required surgical decompression.  FISH studies using BAC clones spanning the 5q15 to 5q22 region revealed that these were all present in both homologues.   The karyotype showed 46, XY, del(1)(q23q31. 2).

"[SOC]###context: When pretreated with a central AADC inhibitor (NSD-1015), further application of l-dopa failed to increase the motoneuron activity although the expression of DA in the AADC cells was not completely inhibited.   Inhibition of Ddc by AADC inhibitor NSD-1015 or anti-sense morpholino oligonucleotides (MO) reduced brain volume and body length.   We evaluated this in vivo by reverse dialysis of the aromatic-l-amino-acid decarboxylase (EC 4. 1. 1. 28) inhibitor NSD-1015 (20μM) and selected concentrations of l- or d-tyrosine.   Neurochemical study of effects of the new anxiolytic drugs afobazol and ladasten on the synthesis and metabolism of monoamines and their metabolites in the brain structures of Wistar rat on the model of monoamine synthesis blockade induced by aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor NSD-1015 To establish the neurotransmitter role(s) of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) in its own right, we attempted to clarify whether i. p.  injection of a DOPA antagonist, DOPA cyclohexyl ester (CHE), would antagonize the behavioral responses of conscious rats to DOPA in the presence of 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD-1015) (100 mg/kg i. p. ), a central aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitor.  TH and TPH activities were determined in tissue extracts by measuring the accumulation of L-Dopa and 5-HTP respectively, following the administration of the aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD-1015.   Results of a neurochemical study of the effects of the new anxiolytic drugs afobazole and ladasten on the synthesis and metabolism of monoamines and their metabolites determined by HPLC on the model of monoamine synthesis blockade induced by NSD-1015 (aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase) in the brain structures of Wistar rats are reported.   .

Monoamine synthesis was studied in different parts of the brain by measuring the accumulated dopa and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), 30 min after NSD 1015 (3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine HCl, 100 mg/kg) an inhibitor of aromatic L-amino-acid decarboxylase, given i. p.  HPLC coupled with electrochemical detection was used to make concurrent measurements of the rate of accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptophan and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine in selected brain regions (striatum, nucleus accumbens, septum, medial periventricular hypothalamus) and thoracic spinal cords of rats treated with NSD 1015, an inhibitor of aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase.  The activity of 5-hydroxytryptaminergic neurons has been estimated from measurements of: concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid; the ratio of the concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid to 5-hydroxytryptamine; the rate of accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptophan following the administration of an aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor (e. g. , NSD 1015); the rate of accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine, and the rate of decline of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid following the administration of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (e. g. , pargyline).  The accumulation of dopa (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) after administration of NSD 1015 to inhibit aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase was determined as an index of NE synthesis.  The central aromatic amino acid DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD-1015, does not inhibit L-DOPA-induced circling in unilateral 6-OHDA-lesioned-rats.  The centrally acting aromatic amino acid dopa decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitor, 3-hydroxybenzyl hydrazine (NSD-1015), is widely used to study the neurotransmitter-like actions of L-DOPA.  The aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD-1015, increases release of dopamine: response characteristics.  The aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor NSD 1015 markedly increased the dopa concentration.  Using a microdialysis technique, the rat striatum was perfused with NSD-1015, an inhibitor of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, and the amount of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) accumulating in dialysate was measured as an index of in vivo activities of tyrosine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase.  Also, we studied the effect of MnCl2 on extracellular levels of l-Dopa in the presence of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitor 3-hydroxybencilhydracine-HCl (NSD 1015).  The role of L-DOPA itself was investigated by administering several doses of an aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD 1015, prior to 100 mg/kg L-DOPA to 5-day-old rats.  An accumulation of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) in the median eminence of female rats treated with 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD 1015), and inhibitor of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (DOPA decarboxylase) activity, was associated with a decreased concentration of dopamine in the median eminence and pronounced reduction in the release of dopamine into hypophysial portal blood.   [Neurochemical study of effects of the new anxiolytic drugs afobazol and ladasten on the synthesis and metabolism of monoamines and their metabolites in the brain structures of Wistar rat on the model of monoamine synthesis blockade induced by aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor NSD-1015].  DOPA was measured in the anterior pituitary and hypothalamic-hypophysial portal blood after treatment with NSD-1015, a DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor.   Central action of an inhibitor of brain dopa-decarboxylase, NSD-1015, on cyanamide-induced alcohol drinking in rats.  The role of L-DOPA itself was investigated by administering several doses of an aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD 1015, prior to 100 mg/kg L-DOPA to 5-day-old rats.   The centrally acting aromatic amino acid dopa decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitor, 3-hydroxybenzyl hydrazine (NSD-1015), is widely used to study the neurotransmitter-like actions of L-DOPA.   Furthermore, the ethanol-induced enhancement of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine accumulation in the mesolimbic dopamine terminal area after NSD 1015 (an inhibitor of l-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase) was completely antagonized by mecamylamine in doses (3. 0 and 6. 0 mg/kg) that exerted no effects per se.  The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine (0. 5 mg/kg s. c. ) enhanced L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels in both the corpus striatum and limbic areas (nucleus accumbens) after inhibition of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase with NSD-1015, indicating an enhanced synthesis of dopamine in these brain regions.  Estradiol benzoate-treated rats had significantly lower anterior pituitary DOPA accumulation after intraperitoneal administration of 3,4-hydroxybenzyl-hydrazine dihydrochloride (NSD-1015), an irreversible inhibitor of L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase whereas methylene blue did not affect anterior pituitary DOPA accumulation when compared to controls.  The accumulation of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) following administration of the L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD 1015, was used to estimate DA synthesis.  Inhibition of PE synthesis by i. p.  injection of the aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD 1015, produced a reversal of the effects of MDL 72,145 and Ro 19-6327.  After 42 hr of abstinence, rats were challenged with either cocaine (15 mg/kg, ip) or saline, followed by the aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD-1015; 100 mg/kg, ip).  Following motor activity observations, the cerebral aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor NSD-1015 (100 mg kg-1 intraperitoneally) was administered and 30 min.  later the animals were decapitated for subsequent analysis of the accumulated forebrain DOPA and 5-HTP levels, as an estimate of the rate of monoamine synthesis.  The utility of this technique was demonstrated by comparing the effects on the scans of halothane and pentobarbital anesthesia and by the administration of NSD 1015, a peripheral and central inhibitor of L-aromatic amino-acid decarboxylase, between back-to-back scans.  Addition of the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD 1015), prevented the formation of N-acetylcompounds from L-[3H]tyrosine, without resulting in an accumulation of label in L-DOPA.  The effects of the peripheral aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitors, carbidopa and benserazide, and the central AADC inhibitor, 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD-1015) on peripheral and brain monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B activity were investigated in the rat.  Although the putative role of NSD-1015 is as an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, the present results demonstrate that, either as a result of this function and/or in addition to this role, NSD-1015 is a potent activator of the release of dopamine.  The aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD-1015, increases release of dopamine: response characteristics.  The central aromatic amino acid DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD-1015, does not inhibit L-DOPA-induced circling in unilateral 6-OHDA-lesioned-rats.

After enrichment by anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, we identified 29 potential novel c-Src substrate proteins.  Combining immunoprecipitation with an antiphosphotyrosine antibody, titanium dioxide phosphopeptide enrichment, isobaric tag for the relative and absolute quantitation methodology, and strong cation exchange separation, we were able to identify 2814 phosphopeptides.  Phosphopeptide fractionation by strong cation exchange chromatography combined with immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) enrichment enabled quantification of more than 8000 distinct phosphorylation sites in Ppt1 wild-type versus Ppt1-deficient yeast cells By employing titanium dioxide in addition to antiphosphotyrosine antibodies as enrichment methods, we identified 4164 phosphopeptides on 1670 phosphoproteins.  Our method combines the use of strong cation exchange (SCX) and titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) for phosphopeptide enrichment, high-resolution MS for peptide and protein identification, and stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) for quantification.

We explored the chromosomal distribution of different classes of CNEs in the human genome.  We employed two methodologies: the scaling of block entropy and box-counting, with the aim to assess fractal characteristics of different CNE datasets.  Both approaches converged to the conclusion that well-developed fractality is characteristic of elements that are either extremely conserved between species or are of ancient origin, i. e.  conserved between distant organisms across evolution.   Conserved noncoding elements follow power-law-like distributions in several genomes as a result of genome dynamics.

Although weight gain and metabolic adverse events had occurred more often with olanzapine and risperidone during the acute trial, no significant between-drug differences emerged in most of these parameters during maintenance treatment.   Olanzapine and risperidone were associated with significantly greater weight gain.  Olanzapine showed the greatest risk of weight gain and significant increases in fasting cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, insulin, and liver transaminase levels.  Molindone led to more self-reports of akathisia.   Molindone is no more or less likely than typical drugs to cause movement disorders, but it does cause significantly more weight loss (2RCTs n=60 RR 2. 78, CI 1. 10 to 6. 99, NNH 5 CI 2 to 77).   Molindone may be an effective antipsychotic but its adverse effect profile does not differ significantly from that of typical antipsychotics (apart from the event of weight loss).   Convergent evidence suggests a hierarchy in the magnitude of BWG that may be induced by diverse agents, being very high for clozapine and olanzapine; high for quetiapine, zotepin, chlorpromazine, and thioridazine; moderate for risperidone and sertindole; and low for ziprazidone, amisulpiride, haloperidol, fluphenazine, pimozide, and molindone.   Loxapine and molindone induce weight decreases, and these exceptions are difficult to explain.  It is no more or less likely than typical drugs to cause movement disorders, but causes significantly more weight loss (RR 2. 78, CI 1. 10 to 6. 99).  Molindone may be an effective antipsychotic; however, its adverse effect profile does not differ significantly from that of typical antipsychotics, apart from the event of weight loss.   Among conventional agents, mean weight change ranged from a reduction of 0. 39 kg with molindone to an increase of 3. 19 kg with thioridazine.  Weight gain has been reported with nearly every antipsychotic drug on the market (molindone is an exception).   Although almost all antipsychotics induce bodyweight gain, molindone and loxapine appear to induce bodyweight loss.   Clozapine and low-potency phenothiazines are associated with the largest gains and molindone with weight loss, but the mechanism is not known.   On average, molindone patients lost 5 pounds over the 6 weeks of treatment, whereas thioridazine patients gained 6 pounds.   Clinically, molindone has a tendency to cause weight loss and may have less effect on seizure threshold than conventional antipsychotic agents  Monthly weights and neuroleptic dosages during the first three months of psychiatric hospitalization were compared between matched groups of patients receiving molindone, a combination of molindone and other neuroleptics, or other neuroleptic drugs.  We found no significant differences in weight gain among the three groups.   The weight-reducing property of molindone, a recently introduced antipsychotic drug, was tested in 9 hospitalized chronic schizophrenic patients.  There was an average weight loss of 7. 6 kg after 3 months on molindone; most of the loss occurred during the first month.

"[SOC]###context: Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) is a powerful method for studying protein-protein interactions in different cell types and organisms.  This method was recently developed in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, allowing analyzing protein interaction properties in a physiologically relevant developing context.  Here we present a detailed protocol for performing BiFC with the Venus fluorescent protein in live Drosophila embryos, taking the Hox-PBC partnership as an illustrative test case.  This protocol applies to any transcription factor and split fluorescent protein in general.  The understanding of developmental complexity will, therefore, require the characterization of protein interactions within their proper environment.  The bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) technology offers this possibility as it enables the direct visualization of protein interactions in living cells.  Using a Hox protein partnership as a test case, we investigated the suitability of BiFC for the study of protein interactions in the living Drosophila embryo.  Importantly, all BiFC parameters were established with constructs that were stably expressed under the control of endogenous promoters.  Under these physiological conditions, we showed that BiFC is specific and sensitive enough to analyse dynamic protein interactions.

Natural RNA circles function as efficient microRNA sponges Recently, miRNA activity has been shown to be affected by the presence of miRNA sponge transcripts, the so-called competing endogenous RNA in humans and target mimicry in plants.

The most popular probiotic supplements among surgeons were probiotic-containing yoghurt and drinks (79. 5% and 71. 8%, respectively), whereas VSL#3 was more popular with gastroenterologists (83. 3%).  The most popular indications were irritable bowel syndrome (70. 7% of prescribers) and pouchitis (67. 5% of prescribers).  Many respondents prescribed long-term probiotics.  Current evidence indicates that probiotic effects are strain-specific, they do not act through the same mechanisms, and nor are all probiotics indicated for the same health conditions.  However, they do share several common features in that they exert anti-inflammatory effects, they employ different strategies to antagonize competing microorganisms, and they induce cytoprotective changes in the host either through enhancement of barrier function, or through the upregulation of cytoprotective host proteins.  Most surveyed physicians recommended probiotics for irritable bowel syndrome, antibiotic, and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea because they believed that the literature supports their usage for these conditions.  This study suggests most gastrointestinal disease specialists recognize a role for and have used probiotics as part of their therapeutic armamentarium probiotics for these patients with small bowel bacterial overgrowth, inflammatory bowel disease, and radiation enteritis.

"[SOC]###context: The H(2)O(2)-dependent sGCβ1 upregulation was attributable to sGCβ1 mRNA stabilization, conditioned by the translocation of the mRNA-binding protein HuR from the nucleus to the cytosol, and the increased mRNA binding of HuR to the sGCβ1 3' untranslated region.  HuR silencing reversed the effects of H(2)O(2) on sGCβ1 levels and cGMP synthesis.  Our results identify H(2)O(2) as an endogenous mediator contributing to the regulation of vascular tone and point to a key role of HuR in sGCβ1 mRNA stabilization.  Cytoplasmic export of the RNA-binding protein HuR, a process that critically regulates its function, was recently shown to be inhibited by the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence.  The in vitro binding selectivity of HuR is indicative of an ARE sequence's ability to destabilize a mRNA in vivo, suggesting a critical role for HuR in the regulation of mRNA degradation.  urification and subsequent analyses demonstrate that this 32 kDa protein is identical to a recently identified member of the Elav-like gene family (ELG) called HuR.  We also show that HuR can be induced to redistribute from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and that this redistribution is associated with an altered function.  RNA stabilization by the AU-rich element binding protein, HuR, an ELAV protein.  ELAV protein HuA (HuR) can redistribute between nucleus and cytoplasm and is upregulated during serum stimulation and T cell activation.   HuR is an RNA-binding protein that can stabilize labile mRNAs containing AU-rich elements in their 3' untranslated regions and has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm (18, 19).  We propose that HuR first may bind AU-rich element-containing mRNAs in the nucleus and then escort them through the nuclear pore, providing protection during and after export to the cytoplasmic compartment.  Taken together, these data show that a correlation exists between the binding of HuR to the AU-rich motif in vitro and the destabilizing properties conferred by this sequence in vivo.  HuR interacts with AU-rich elements in the 3'UTR of many protooncogenes, cytokines, and transcription factors, thereby regulating the expression of these mRNAs on the posttranscriptional level.  Transfection assays with a CAT reporter construct revealed reduced expression of the reporter, suggesting that HuR may be involved in the fine-tuning of the expression of the NF1 gene.  Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype.  Our studies highlight a critical role for HuR during the process of replicative senescence.  Here, using two models of replicative senescence, we describe the influence of the RNA-binding protein HuR in regulating the expression of several genes whose expression decreases during senescence We demonstrate that HuR levels, HuR binding to target mRNAs encoding proliferative genes, and the half-lives of such mRNAs are lower in senescent cells.  Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence.  Although in vitro experiments showed indiscriminate binding of Hu proteins synthesized in bacterial systems to many different AU-rich elements (AREs), in vivo studies have pointed to a cytoplasmic role for HuR protein in antagonizing the rapid decay of some specific ARE-containing mRNAs, depending on physiological situations.  Our data suggest that the ARE-binding specificity of HuR in vivo is modulated to interact only with and thus regulate specific AREs in a cell type- and physiological state-dependent manner.  Overexpression of HuD and HuR in murine fibroblasts caused a striking stabilization of the endogenous MARCKS mRNA even under conditions when the MARCKS mRNA is normally actively degraded, i. e.  after treating cells with phorbol ester.   Our findings implicate mRNA stabilization in the cytokine-mediated increase in eotaxin expression and strongly suggest a role for HuR in this effect.  Proteasome inhibition increases HuR level, restores heat-inducible HSP72 expression and thermotolerance in WI-38 senescent human fibroblasts.  This result is consistent with the proposed role of HuR in assisting mRNA export to the cytoplasm and in antagonizing its degradation.  HuR immunoprecipitations were positive for RhoB mRNA indicating an in vivo association, and Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence demonstrated that HuR rapidly partitions from the nucleus to the cytoplasm after UVL In the cytosol, HuR is thought to function to control stability and translation of its ligand message.   HuR is a ligand for nuclear mRNAs containing adenylate-uridylate-rich (ARE) elements in the 3'-untranslated region.  Once bound to the mRNA, HuR is recognized by adapter proteins that then facilitate nuclear export of the complex.  In the cytosol, HuR is thought to function to control stability and translation of its ligand message.  HuR is a ligand for nuclear mRNAs containing adenylate-uridylate rich elements in the 3'-untranslated region.  Once bound to the mRNA, HuR is recognized by adapter proteins which then facilitate nuclear export of the complex.  In the cytosol HuR is thought to function to control stability and translation of its ligand message.  The RNA binding protein HuR regulates the stability of many target mRNAs.  Here, we report that HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels.  In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the ATP analogue adenosine-5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate-induced nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the mRNA stabilizing factor HuR in human (h) mesangial cells (MC).   HuR is an essential regulator of mesenchymal responses during lung branching.  Our data reveals HuR as the first RBP identified to play a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis.  Here we demonstrated a relevance for miR-9 in HL pathogenesis and identified two new targets Dicer1 and HuR.  We show that inhibition of miR-9 leads to derepression of DICER and HuR, which in turn results in a decrease in cytokine production by HL cells followed by an impaired ability to attract normal inflammatory cells.  A conserved TGFβ1/HuR feedback circuit regulates the fibrogenic response in fibroblasts.  Knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  Our study here established a TGFβ1/HuR feedback circuit regulating the fibrogenic response in fibroblasts, and targeting this feedback loop is of great potential to control fibrosis.  Here, we demonstrated that increased stabilization and subsequent over-expression of HuR mRNA were coupled to TTP deficiency.  These findings were observed in breast cancer cell lines with an invasive phenotype and were further confirmed in ZFP36-knockout mouse fibroblasts.  We show that TTP-HuR imbalance correlated with increased expression of AU-rich element (ARE) mRNAs that code for cancer invasion genes.  Here, we show that an RNA-binding protein, HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).  The outcome of this analysis was a list of target genes regulated via HuR for their association (either increased or reduced) with the nuclear hnRNP A1-RNP complexes.  The differentially enriched mRNAs were found to belong to GO categories relevant to biological processes anticipated for hnRNP A1 and HuR (such as transport, transcription, translation, apoptosis and cell cycle) indicating their concerted function in mRNA metabolism.  Here, we show that overexpression of RNase L decreases cellular growth and downmodulates the RNA-binding protein, HuR, a regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis.  In sum, our results indicate that NO stabilizes mRNA subsets in fibroblasts, identify HuR as an RBP implicated in the NO response, reveal that HuR alone is insufficient for stabilizing several mRNAs by NO, and show that HO-1 induction by NO is regulated by HuR.  Suppression of HuR using siRNA resulted in an attenuation of the 3T3-L1 differentiation program, consistent with HuR control of the expression of mRNA ligand(s) critical to the differentiation process.  In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, HuR bound to and stabilized the mRNA for Mdm2, a critical negative regulator of p53.  Our results reveal a positive feedback mechanism for the regulation of HuR, which may play an important role in the regulation of HuR during replicative senescence.  In dividing cells, the RNA-binding protein HuR associates with and stabilizes labile mRNAs encoding proliferative proteins, events that are linked to the increased cytoplasmic presence of HuR.  On the basis of these observations, we postulated a role for HuR in promoting the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells.  We propose that HuR contributes to regulating hVSMC growth and homeostasis in pathologies associated with vascular smooth muscle proliferation.  Antiapoptotic function of RNA-binding protein HuR effected through prothymosin alpha.  We report the antiapoptotic effect of RNA-binding protein HuR, a critical regulator of the post-transcriptional fate of target transcripts.  Together, our data support a regulatory scheme whereby HuR binds the ProTalpha mRNA, elevates its cytoplasmic abundance and translation, and thereby elicits an antiapoptotic program.  CARM1 represses replicative senescence by methylating HuR and thereby enhancing HuR's ability to regulate the turnover of cyclin A, cyclin B1, c-fos, SIRT1, and p16 mRNAs.  HuR, also known as Elavl1, is an RNA-binding protein that regulates embryonic development, progenitor cell survival, and cell stress responses.  Together, these studies reveal an evolutionarily conserved post-transcriptional mechanism involving competitive interactions between HuR and miR-200b that controls angiogenesis.  Immunoprecipitation of RNA-protein complexes and luciferase reporter assays indicate that HuR antagonizes the suppressive activity of miR-200b, down-regulates miR-200b expression, and promotes VEGF-A expression.  Here we present evidence that CUGBP1 and HuR jointly regulate the translation of occludin and play a crucial role in the maintenance of tight junction (TJ) integrity in the intestinal epithelial cell monolayer.  These findings indicate that CUGBP1 represses occludin translation by increasing occludin mRNA recruitment to P-bodies, whereas HuR promotes occludin translation by blocking occludin mRNA translocation to P-bodies via the displacement of CUGBP1.  Through its post-transcriptional influence on specific target mRNAs, HuR can alter the cellular response to proliferative, stress, apoptotic, differentiation, senescence, inflammatory and immune stimuli.  We focus on HuR's well-recognized implication in cancer and chronic inflammation, and discuss emerging studies linking HuR to cardiovascular, neurological, and muscular pathologies.  We also discuss the progress, potential, and challenges of targeting HuR therapeutically.  These results indicate that HuR regulates occludin mRNA translation through Chk2-dependent HuR phosphorylation and that this influence is crucial for maintenance of the epithelial barrier integrity in the intestinal tract.  The RNA-binding protein HuR modulates the stability and translation of many target mRNAs.  Here, we investigated the role of HuR in the regulation of occludin expression and therefore in the intestinal epithelial barrier function.  HuR bound the 3'-untranslated region of the occludin mRNA and enhanced occludin translation.  HuR association with the occludin mRNA depended on Chk2-dependent HuR phosphorylation.

In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.   HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).  HuR is considered a global regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis.  Through its post-transcriptional influence on specific target mRNAs, HuR can alter the cellular response to proliferative, stress, apoptotic, differentiation, senescence, inflammatory and immune stimuli.

"[SOC]###context: The DNA-organizing mechanism of condensin depends on the energy of ATP hydrolysis but how this activity specifically promotes proper compaction and segregation of chromosomes during mitosis remains poorly understood.  We suggest that loading and translocation are mediated by conformational changes in cohesin's hinge driven by cycles of ATP hydrolysis.  Using ultra-deep Hi-C, we show that loop domains form by a process that requires cohesin ATPases.  Strikingly, without ATP, we observe the emergence of hundreds of CTCF-independent loops that link regulatory DNA.   Each TAD emerges from multiple loops dynamically formed through extrusion, contrary to typical illustrations of single static loops.   However, the model requires a motor to generate the loops, and although cohesin is a strong candidate for the extruding factor, a suitable motor protein (or a motor activity in cohesin itself) has yet to be found.  Here we explore a new hypothesis: that there is no motor, and thermal motion within the nucleus drives extrusion.  We observed that a single condensin complex is able to extrude tens of kilobase pairs of DNA at a force-dependent speed of up to 1500 base pairs per second, using the energy of adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis Our model explains what can be the driving force of chromatin loop extrusion and how it can be ensured that loops grow quickly and in a good direction.  In addition, the supercoiling-driven loop extrusion mechanism is consistent with earlier explanations proposing why TADs flanked by convergent CTCF binding sites form more stable chromatin loops than TADs flanked by divergent CTCF binding sites.  Oligomerization and ATP stimulate condensin-mediated DNA compaction.  Strikingly, without ATP, we observe the emergence of hundreds of CTCF-independent loops that link regulatory DNA.  DNA compaction by cohesin requires adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis and is force sensitive.  The identification and quantification of further initiation steps--ATP binding and extrusion of an initial DNA loop--allowed us to deduce a complete kinetic reinitiation scheme.  In support of this model, single-molecule imaging experiments indicate that Saccharomyces cerevisiae condensin complexes can extrude DNA loops in an ATP-hydrolysis-dependent manner in vitro.  These structures depend on cohesin, a ring-shaped DNA-entrapping adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) complex that has been proposed to form loops by extrusion.  Loop formation and maintenance depend on cohesin's ATPase activity and on NIPBL-MAU2, but not on topological entrapment of DNA by cohesin.

"[SOC]###context: Diagnostic performance of central vein sign for multiple sclerosis with a simplified three-lesion algorithm.  BACKGROUND: Detection of a ""central vein sign"" (CVS) on FLAIR* magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is highly specific and sensitive for multiple sclerosis (MS).   CONCLUSION: A simplified determination of CVS in three white matter lesions on 3T FLAIR* MRI demonstrated good specificity and sensitivity and fair inter-rater reliability for a diagnosis of MS and with further study, may be a candidate for clinical application.  Central vein sign differentiates Multiple Sclerosis from central nervous system inflammatory vasculopathies.  Detection of perivenular lesions in the brain (the ""central vein sign"") improves the pathological specificity of MS diagnosis, but comprehensive evaluation of this MRI biomarker in MS-mimicking inflammatory and/or autoimmune diseases, such as central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory vasculopathies, is lacking.  INTERPRETATION: The central vein sign differentiates inflammatory CNS vasculopathies from MS at standard clinical magnetic field strengths.  Areas covered: An overview of 7T MRI applications in MS focusing on increased sensitivity for lesion detection, specificity of the central vein sign and better understanding of MS pathophysiology.   Value of the central vein sign at 3T to differentiate MS from seropositive NMOSD.  OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of the central vein sign (CVS) on a clinical 3T scanner to distinguish between multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD).  CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that the CVS on 3T MRI accurately distinguishes patients with MS from those with seropositive NMOSD.  Evaluation of the Central Vein Sign as a Diagnostic Imaging Biomarker in Multiple Sclerosis.  Objective  To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of various central vein sign lesion criteria for differentiating MS from non-MS conditions using 3T brain MRI with various commonly used pulse sequences.  The sensitivity was 68. 1% and specificity was 82. 9% for distinguishing MS from not MS using a 35% central vein sign proportion threshold.  Importance  The central vein sign has been proposed as a specific imaging biomarker for distinguishing between multiple sclerosis (MS) and not MS, mainly based on findings from ultrahigh-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies.  Conclusions and Relevance  In this study, use of the central vein sign at 3T MRI yielded a high specificity and a moderate sensitivity in differentiating MS from not MS; international, multicenter studies may be needed to ascertain whether the central vein sign-based criteria can accurately detect MS.  Conclusion The presence of the central vein sign on susceptibility-weighted images for MS lesions improves the understanding of the periventricular distribution of MS lesions and could contribute as adjunctive diagnostic criteria for MS disease.  The central vein sign should be considered as a diagnostic biomarker in MS.  The central vein sign has the potential to be a non-invasive, MS-specific biomarker.

"[SOC]###context: Recessively inherited CPVT is caused by either missense or null-allele mutations in the cardiac calsequestrin (CASQ2) gene.  It was suggested that defects in CASQ2 cause protein deficiency and impair Ca(2+) uptake to the sarcoplasmic reticulum and Ca(2+)-dependent inhibition of ryanodine channels, leading to diastolic Ca(2+) leak, after-depolarizations, and arrhythmia.   The autosomal recessive form of CPVT is caused by mutations in the CASQ2 gene.  In a consanguineous family, a novel homozygous CASQ2 mutation (p. L77P) was identified in a child with CPVT who required implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator due to episodes of syncope while on medical therapy.   Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is a familial cardiac arrhythmia that is related to RYR2 or CASQ2 gene mutation.  Thirteen mutations in the CASQ2 gene have been reported so far in association with CPVT.   These data increased significantly the number of CASQ2 mutations described in association with CPVT, revealed the high prevalence of splicing and truncating mutations in this gene and brought new insight regarding the dominant inheritance of the disease.  Moreover, our report of the first splicing abnormalities in CASQ2 caused by intronic mutation or synonymous change underlines the absolute necessity to perform extensive molecular analysis for genetic diagnosis and counseling of CPVT.  Mutations in the human cardiac calsequestrin gene (CASQ2) are linked to catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT-2).  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a familial cardiac arrhythmia that is related to RYR2 or CASQ2 gene mutation.   Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an uncommon heritable disease presenting with syncope or sudden cardiac death.  Two genes involved in calcium homeostasis, the ryanodine receptor gene and the calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2) gene, have been implicated in this disease.  We describe a young man presenting with exercise-induced syncope, clinically diagnosed as CPVT.  Genetic analysis revealed two mutations, p. Y55C (c. 164A>G) and p. P308L (c. 923C>T), in the CASQ2 gene.   A novel heterozygous mutation, F189L, in CASQ2 gene was identified in one family with CPVT.  Catecholamine-induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a familial disorder caused by cardiac ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2) or calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2) gene mutations.   We conclude that CPVT-causing CASQ2 missense mutations function as null alleles.   The central role of RyR2 dysfunction in CASQ2 deficiency unifies the pathophysiologic mechanism underlying CPVT due to RyR2 or CASQ2 mutations and suggests a therapeutic approach for these inherited cardiac arrhythmias.  Mutations of the RyR2 gene cause autosomal dominant CPVT, while mutations of the CASQ2 gene may cause an autosomal recessive or dominant form of CPVT.   Mutations of two myocardial calcium signaling molecules, ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2) and calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2), may cause catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), a severe inherited arrhythmic disease manifesting with salvoes of exercise-induced bidirectional and polymorphic tachycardias.   These data, combined with our previous findings, show that RYR2 mutations are present in at least 6/16 (38%) of the catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia families, while CASQ2 mutations must be a rare cause of CPVT.  This report reviews evidence that a missense mutation in the CASQ2 gene is associated with autosomal-recessive CPVT.  An Australian cohort of 252 unrelated familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients were screened for mutations in the Ca(2+) regulatory genes, sorcin (SRI), calstabin (FKBP1B), calsequestrin (CASQ2), phospholamban (PLN), sarcolipin (SLN), calreticulin (CALR3) and calmodulin (CALM).  A total of 17 exonic DNA variants were identified in the 7 Ca(2+) regulatory genes studied, of which 4 were considered of pathogenic significance.  Two novel mutations in the CALR3 gene were identified (Lys82Arg, Arg73Gln) and one truncation mutation in the PLN gene (Leu39Ter).  A variant was also identified in the CASQ2 gene (Asp63Glu).  These four variants were all novel, resulted in changes in conserved amino acids and were not identified in a normal population.

Identification of STAG1 as a key mediator of a p53-dependent apoptotic pathway.  The STAG1 gene was one of the transcripts showing higher expression levels in cells infected with Ad-p53-121F as opposed to Ad-wtp53.   the expression of STAG1 mRNA was induced in response to various genotoxic stresses in a p53-dependent manner; moreover, enforced expression of STAG1 led to apoptosis in several additional cancer cell lines.  Differential regulation of telomere and centromere cohesion by the Scc3 homologues SA1 and SA2, respectively, in human cells.  Here, we show that cohesin(SA1) and cohesin(SA2) are differentially required for telomere and centromere cohesion, respectively.  These results suggest that at telomeres cohesion relies on the molecular interplay between TRF1 and SA1 to promote DNA-DNA pairing, while along chromosomal arms the core cohesin assembly might also depend on SA1 1D diffusion on DNA and sequence-specific DNA binding.   Here we show that the loss-of-function of STAG2, a core component of cohesin and an emerging tumour suppressor, leads to synthetic dependency of mutated cancer cells on its paralog STAG1 In all cases, we observed that the simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell proliferation.   cohesin-SA1 preferentially contributes to the stabilization of topologically associating domain boundaries together with CTCF, whereas cohesin-SA2 promotes cell-type-specific contacts between enhancers and promoters independently of CTCF.  Expression analyses of Gli1-expressing NSCs identified significant induction of Gadd45a and decreased cyclin A2 and Stag1 mRNA, genes involved in the G2-M transition and apoptosis Finally, we show that Nanog physically interacts with the cohesin or cohesin interacting proteins STAG1 and WAPL further substantiating this association.  A striking finding was the identification of members of the cohesin complex (STAG2, RAD21, STAG1, and SMC3) among the top 20 genes from the screen.

"[SOC]###context: Malfunction of the circadian clock has been linked to the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases.  We show that mice lacking the core clock components Cryptochrome-1 (Cry1) and Cryptochrome-2 (Cry2) (Cry-null mice) show salt-sensitive hypertension due to abnormally high synthesis of the mineralocorticoid aldosterone by the adrenal gland.  The Cryptochrome 1 and 2 genes are indispensable for molecular core oscillator function, as evident from the arrhythmic wheel-running behavior and lack of rhythmic clock gene expression in mCry1/mCry2 double-mutant mice in constant darkness.  Among the components driving the mammalian circadian clock are the Period 1 and 2 (mPer1 and mPer2) and Cryptochrome 1 and 2 (mCry1 and mCry2) genes.  A mutation in the mPer2 gene leads to a gradual loss of circadian rhythmicity in mice kept in constant darkness (DD).  Here we show that inactivation of the mCry2 gene in mPer2 mutant mice restores circadian rhythmicity and normal clock gene expression patterns.  Thus, mCry2 can act as a nonallelic suppressor of mPer2, which points to direct or indirect interactions of PER2 and CRY2 proteins.  In marked contrast, inactivation of mCry1 in mPer2 mutant mice does not restore circadian rhythmicity but instead results in complete behavioral arrhythmicity in DD, indicating different effects of mCry1 and mCry2 in the clock mechanism Cryptochrome 1 and 2 gene products act in the negative feedback loop and are indispensable for molecular core oscillator function, as evident from the arrhythmic wheel running behaviour and absence of cyclic clock gene expression in mCry1/mCry2 double mutant mice in constant darkness.  , when mCry-deficient mice are housed in normal light-dark cycles, a single non-circadian peak in neuronal activity can be detected in SCN slices prepared two hours after the beginning of the day.  This light-induced increase in electric activity of the SCN suggests that deletion of the mCry genes converts the core oscillator in an hour-glass-like timekeeper and may explain why in normal day-night cycles mCry-deficient mice show apparently normal behaviour.  Cryptochrome 1 and 2 act as essential components of the central and peripheral circadian clocks for generation of circadian rhythms in mammals cryptochrome-1 mRNA was found in DA cells, immunocytochemistry was extended to other components of the circadian clock machinery.  This analysis showed that DA cells contain the most common clock-related proteins.  Cryptochrome 1 and cryptochrome 2 proteins are core components of the mammalian circadian clock and mice mutated in both genes are arrhythmic.  a domain in the extreme C terminus of BMAL1 that plays an essential role in the rhythmic control of E-box-mediated circadian transcription.  Remarkably, the last 43 aa of BMAL1 are required for transcriptional activation, as well as for association with the circadian transcriptional repressor CRYPTOCHROME 1 (CRY1), depending on the coexistence of CLOCK protein.  circadian rhythm protein cryptochrome 1 (CRY1).  CRY1 is a master regulator of circadian rhythm that regulates the extracellular calcification of MSCs.  Studying mouse fibroblasts, we demonstrated that the nutrient-responsive adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylates and destabilizes the clock component cryptochrome 1 (CRY1).  In mouse livers, AMPK activity and nuclear localization were rhythmic and inversely correlated with CRY1 nuclear protein abundance.  Stimulation of AMPK destabilized cryptochromes and altered circadian rhythms, and mice in which the AMPK pathway was genetically disrupted showed alterations in peripheral clocks.  Thus, phosphorylation by AMPK enables cryptochrome to transduce nutrient signals to circadian clocks in mammalian peripheral organs.  Cytoplasmic hnRNP D levels displayed a pattern that was reciprocal to the mcry1 oscillation.  Knockdown of hnRNP D stabilized mcry1 mRNA and resulted in enhancement of the oscillation amplitude and a slight delay of the phase.  Our results suggest that hnRNP D plays a role as a fine regulator contributing to the mcry1 mRNA turnover rate and the modulation of circadian rhythm.  more than three mutations of conserved PER2 residues impaired not only binding to CRY1 but also subsequent nuclear translocation, although mutations of non-conserved residues did not affect interaction with CRY1.  Thus, the conserved amino acid residues of 1179-1198 in PER2 are apparently responsible for binding to CRY1.  Cryptochrome 1 and 2 (Cry1 and Cry2) are considered essential for generating circadian rhythms in mammals.  The role of Cry1 and Cry2 in circadian rhythm expression and acute light-induced suppression of pineal melatonin was assessed using Cry1 and Cry2 double-deficient mice (Cry1(-/-) /Cry2(-/-) ) developed from the C3H strain that synthesizes melatonin.  Cryptochrome 1 (Cry1), an essential clock component, displays evening-time expression and serves as a strong repressor at morning-time elements (E box/E' box).  A genetic complementation assay in Cry1(-/-):Cry2(-/-) cells revealed that substantial delay of Cry1 expression is required to restore circadian rhythmicity, and its prolonged delay slows circadian oscillation.  Taken together, our data suggest that phase delay in Cry1 transcription is required for mammalian clock function.  the 24-h mRNA rhythms of the following genes were suppressed in db/db mice compared with control mice: the clock genes period homolog 1/2 (Per1/2) and cryptochrome 1/2 (Cry1/2) and their target genes D site albumin promoter-binding protein (Dbp) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (Pparg) in the aorta and mesenteric arteries; Dbp in the heart; Per1, nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1 (Rev-erba), and Dbp in the kidney; and Per1 in the suprachiasmatic nucleus.  In mammals, circadian rhythms in behavior and physiology are controlled by a central pacemaker, the SCN, and subordinated clocks throughout the body.  On the molecular level, these clocks are based on transcriptional/translational feedback loops involving a set of clock genes that regulate their own transcription.  Among the components driving the mammalian circadian clock are the Period 1 and 2 (Per1 and Per2) and Cryptochrome 1 and 2 (Cry1 and Cry2) genes.  I The mammalian clock protein, cryptochrome 1 (CRY1), is degraded via the FBXL3-mediated ubiquitination pathway, suggesting that it is also likely to be targeted by the deubiquitination pathway.  Here, we identified that USP2a, a circadian-controlled deubiquitinating enzyme, interacts with CRY1 and enhances its protein stability via deubiquitination upon serum shock.  Depletion of Usp2a by shRNA greatly enhances the ubiquitination of CRY1 and dampens the oscillation amplitude of the CRY1 protein during a circadian cycle.  By stabilizing the CRY1 protein, USP2a represses the Per2 promoter activity as well as the endogenous Per2 gene expression.  We also demonstrated that USP2a-dependent deubiquitination and stabilization of the CRY1 protein occur in the mouse liver.  The mammalian circadian clock is composed of interlocking feedback loops.  Cryptochrome is a central component in the core negative feedback loop, whereas Rev-Erbα, a member of the nuclear receptor family, is an essential component of the interlocking loop.  By analyzing the Fbxl3 and Cryptochrome 1 double-mutant mice, we found that FBXL3 also regulates the amplitudes of E-box-driven gene expression.  These two separate roles of FBXL3 in circadian feedback loops provide a mechanism that contributes to the period determination and robustness of the clock.

Symmetrical dimethylation of arginine residues in spliceosomal Sm protein B/B' and the Sm-like protein LSm4, and their interaction with the SMN protein.  Interestingly, SMN also interacts with at least two of the U6-associated Sm-like (Lsm) proteins, Lsm4 and Lsm6.  Furthermore, the carboxyl-terminal arginine- and glycine-rich domain of Lsm4 directly interacts with SMN.  This entity promotes the binding of a set of factors, termed LSm/Sm proteins, onto snRNA to form the core structure of these particles.   Toward an assembly line for U7 snRNPs: interactions of U7-specific Lsm proteins with PRMT5 and SMN complexes.  In this report, we demonstrate that the coilin C-terminal domain binds directly to various Sm and Lsm proteins via their Sm motifs.  We show that the region of coilin responsible for this binding activity is separable from that which binds to SMN.  Thus, the ability to interact with free Sm (and Lsm) proteins as well as with intact snRNPs, indicates that coilin and CBs may facilitate the modification of newly formed snRNPs, the regeneration of 'mature' snRNPs, or the reclamation of unassembled snRNP components.  Moreover this structure has important consequences for snRNP assembly that is mediated by two complexes containing the PRMT5 methyltransferase and the SMN (survival of motor neurons) protein, respectively.  Arginine/glycine (RG)-rich domains in components of the SMN complex interact with Sm, like-Sm (LSm), fibrillarin, RNA helicase A (Gu), and coilin proteins, all of which are antigen targets in a variety of diseases.

"[SOC]###context: Neural correlates of distraction in borderline personality disorder before and after dialectical behavior therapy.  It is unknown whether neural correlates of emotion regulation change after a psychotherapy which has the goal to improve emotion dysregulation in BPD, such as dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT).   In conclusion, our findings reveal changes in neural activity associated with distraction during emotion processing after DBT in patients with BPD.  ObjectiveInvestigate influence and change of self-directedness (SD) in Dialectical-Behavior Therapy (DBT) for 26 female outpatients with borderline personality disorder (BPS).  ConclusionDBT strengthens the SD of patients with BPD.  OBJECTIVE: Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is an evidence-based psychosocial treatment with efficacy in reducing self-harm behaviors in borderline personality disorder (BPD).   CONCLUSION: This DBT curriculum was effective in preparing psychiatrists-in-training to incorporate evidence-based practices for effective treatment of BPD and self-harm behaviors and can serve as a model for teaching DBT during psychiatry residency training.  Exploring the effectiveness of combined mentalization-based group therapy and dialectical behaviour therapy for inpatients with borderline personality disorder - A pilot study.  Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) has proven highly effective in reducing self-harm and improving emotion regulation, whereby problems concerning social cognition, which are also characteristic of BPD, may need additional approaches such as mentalization-based treatment (MBT).  Pain-mediated affect regulation is reduced after dialectical behavior therapy in borderline personality disorder: a longitudinal fMRI study.  Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is characterized by affective instability, but self-injurious behavior appears to have an emotion-regulating effect.  We investigated whether pain-mediated affect regulation can be altered at the neural level by residential Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), providing adaptive emotion regulation techniques.   Use of dialectical behavior therapy in borderline personality disorder: a view from residency.  Of evaluated psychological treatments in borderline personality disorder, dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) has the strongest research support, followed by mentalization based therapy (MBT).  The authors describe the use of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) in treating borderline personality disorder during psychiatry residency, and assess the status of DBT education within psychiatry residencies in the United States.  Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) was originally developed by Marsha Linehan (1991) for the treatment of borderline personality disorder, but because of the core deficits in emotion regulation in disruptive behavior disorders, DBT is also increasingly being recommended for the treatment of CD and APD.  Treatment of suicidal and deliberate self-harming patients with borderline personality disorder using dialectical behavioral therapy: the patients' and the therapists' perceptions.  Dialectical behavioral therapy and schema-focused therapy also caused a soaring remission rate of diagnostic borderline personality disorder criteria of 57% and 94%, respectively.  OBJECTIVE: Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is an empirically supported treatment for outpatients with borderline personality disorder.  OBJECTIVE The authors describe the use of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) in treating borderline personality disorder during psychiatry residency, and assess the status of DBT education within psychiatry residencies in the United States.  CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that dialectical behavior therapy is a promising psychosocial intervention for improving interpersonal functioning among severely dysfunctional patients with borderline personality disorder.  A central component of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is the teaching of specific behavioral skills with the aim of helping individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) replace maladaptive behaviors with skillful behavior.  Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) was originally designed as a treatment of emotionally dysregulated, impulsive, and dramatic disorders (e. g. , borderline personality disorder) and populations (e. g. , parasuicidal women).  Dialectical behavior therapy, an outpatient psychosocial treatment for chronically suicidal women with borderline personality disorder, has been adapted for use in a partial hospital program for women.  OBJECTIVE At present, the most frequently investigated psychosocial intervention for borderline personality disorder (BPD) is dialectical behavior therapy (DBT).  Linehan developed ""dialectical behavioral therapy"" specifically to treat chronically suicidal borderline patients.  Use of dialectical behavior therapy in borderline personality disorder: a view from residency.  These results suggest that individuals with borderline personality disorder benefited equally from dialectical behavior therapy and a well-specified treatment delivered by psychiatrists with expertise in the treatment of borderline personality disorder. .

"[SOC]###context: The general definition has been expanded into five subtypes: CRS type 1 = acute worsening of heart function (acute heart failure-acute coronary syndrome) leading to kidney injury and/or dysfunction; CRS type 2 = chronic abnormalities in heart function (chronic heart failure-chronic heart disease) leading to kidney injury or dysfunction; CRS type 3 = acute worsening of kidney function (acute kidney injury) leading to heart injury and/or dysfunction; CRS type 4 = chronic kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) leading to heart injury, disease and/or dysfunction; and CRS type 5 = systemic conditions leading to simultaneous injury and/or dysfunction of heart and kidney.   Cardiorenal syndromes (CRS) have been recently classified into five distinct entities, each with different major pathophysiologic mechanisms.  CRS type 1 most commonly occurs in the setting of acutely decompensated heart failure where approximately 25% of patients develop a rise in serum creatinine and a reduction of urine output after the first several doses of intravenous diuretics.   CRS type 2 is the hastened progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the setting of chronic heart failure.   CRS type 3 is acutely decompensated heart failure after acute kidney injury from inflammatory, toxic, or ischemic insults.   CRS type 4 is manifested by the acceleration of the progression of chronic heart failure in the setting of CKD.  Cardiac myocyte dysfunction and fibrosis, so-called 'CKD cardiomyopathy', is believed to be the predominant pathophysiologic mechanism.  Type 5 CRS is simultaneous acute cardiac and renal injury in the setting of an overwhelming systemic insult such as sepsis.   CRS type I: acute worsening of heart function (AHF-ACS) leading to kidney injury and/or dysfunction.  CRS type II: chronic abnormalities in heart function (CHF-CHD) leading to kidney injury or dysfunction.  CRS type III: acute worsening of kidney function (AKI) leading to heart injury and/or dysfunction.  CRS type IV: chronic kidney disease (CKD) leading to heart injury, disease and/or dysfunction.  CRS type V: systemic conditions leading to simultaneous injury and/or dysfunction of heart and kidney.   Acute CRS (type 1): acute worsening of heart function (AHF-ACS) leading to kidney injury and/or dysfunction.  Chronic cardio-renal syndrome (type 2): chronic abnormalities in heart function (CHF-CHD) leading to kidney injury and/or dysfunction.  Acute reno-cardiac syndrome (type 3): acute worsening of kidney function (AKI) leading to heart injury and/or dysfunction.  Chronic reno-cardiac syndrome (type 4): chronic kidney disease leading to heart injury, disease, and/or dysfunction.  Secondary CRS (type 5): systemic conditions leading to simultaneous injury and/or dysfunction of heart and kidney.   For mentioning the interaction of cardiovascular and renal diseases the cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) term was introduced, with its classification on 5 types, according to the presence of acute/chronic heart failure and primary/secondary origination of heart and kidney injury.  For mentioning the interaction of cardiovascular and renal diseases the cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) term was introduced, with its classification on 5 types, according to the presence of acute/chronic heart failure and primary/secondary origination of heart and kidney injury The most recent classification recognizes five types of CRS: types I and II originate from heart failure (acute and chronic, respectively), type III and IV from kidney failure (again acute and chronic), while type V originates from a range of systemic diseases The most recent classification recognizes five types of CRS: types I and II originate from heart failure (acute and chronic, respectively), type III and IV from kidney failure (again acute and chronic), while type V originates from a range of systemic diseases.  For mentioning the interaction of cardiovascular and renal diseases the cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) term was introduced, with its classification on 5 types, according to the presence of acute/chronic heart failure and primary/secondary origination of heart and kidney injury.  Based on the pathophysiological primum movens, the actual classification recognizes five CRS types: in type I and II CRS, the initiating event is heart failure (acute or chronic), while it is kidney failure in type III and IV CRS; type V is linked to systemic diseases.  An effective classification of CRS in 2008 essentially divides CRS in two main groups, cardiorenal and renocardiac CRS, based on primum movens of disease (cardiac or renal); both cardiorenal and renocardiac CRS are then divided into acute and chronic, according to onset of disease.  Of particular interest to the critical care specialist are CRS type 1 (acute cardiorenal syndrome) and type 3 (acute renocardiac syndrome).  At present, the classification of the syndrome includes five types of CRS: types I and II which are strictly related to initial heart failure (both acute and chronic), types III and IV which include initial kidney failure, and type V which includes several systemic diseases.  The general definition has been expanded into five subtypes: CRS type 1 = acute worsening of heart function (acute heart failure-acute coronary syndrome) leading to kidney injury and/or dysfunction; CRS type 2 = chronic abnormalities in heart function (chronic heart failure-chronic heart disease) leading to kidney injury or dysfunction; CRS type 3 = acute worsening of kidney function (acute kidney injury) leading to heart injury and/or dysfunction; CRS type 4 = chronic kidney disease (chronic kidney disease) leading to heart injury, disease and/or dysfunction; and CRS type 5 = systemic conditions leading to simultaneous injury and/or dysfunction of heart and kidney.  The general definition has been expanded into five subtypes reflecting the primacy of organ dysfunction and the time-frame of the syndrome: CRS type 1 = acute worsening of heart function leading to kidney injury and/or dysfunction; CRS type 2 = chronic abnormalities in heart function leading to kidney injury or dysfunction; CRS type 3 = acute worsening of kidney function leading to heart injury and/or dysfunction; CRS type 4 = chronic kidney disease leading to heart injury, disease and/or dysfunction, and CRS type 5 = systemic conditions leading to simultaneous injury and/or dysfunction of heart and kidney.

"[SOC]###context: Anlotinib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, has already shown antitumor effects in various types of carcinoma in a phase I clinical trial.   OBJECTIVES: AL3818 (anlotinib) is a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2/KDR, and VEGFR3), stem cell factor receptor (C-kit), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFβ), and fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3).   In the present study, we detailed the pharmacological properties of anlotinib, a highly potent and selective VEGFR2 inhibitor, in preclinical models.   In this research, we demonstrated that anlotinib, a potent multi-tyrosine kinases inhibitor (TKI), showed a significant inhibitory effect on VEGF/PDGF-BB/FGF-2-induced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo.  Wound healing assay, chamber directional migration assay and tube formation assay indicated that anlotinib inhibited VEGF/PDGF-BB/FGF-2-induced cell migration and formation of capillary-like tubes in endothelial cells.   Mechanistically, anlotinib inhibits the activation of VEGFR2, PDGFRβ and FGFR1 as well their common downstream ERK signaling.   Anlotinib inhibits angiogenesis via suppressing the activation of VEGFR2, PDGFRβ and FGFR1.

"[SOC]###context: Superficial hand infections are located superficial to the tendons and are comprised of cellulitis, lymphangitis, paronychia, pulp-space infections, herpetic whitlow, and include volar as well as dorsal subcutaneous abscesses.   CONTEXT: Herpetic whitlow is caused by herpes virus (type1 or 2) during primary infection or as result of autoinoculation.  Commonly, it is caused by HSV-2 in adults with positive history for genital infection.  CONCLUSION: The case here reported demonstrates that herpetic whitlow should be kept in mind by physicians in recurrent cases of fingers infection.   INTRODUCTION: Whitlow is an infection of a finger or around the fingernails, generally caused by bacterium.  However, in rare cases, it may also be caused by the herpes simplex virus.  As herpetic whitlow is not seen often, it may go under-recognised or be mistaken for a different kind of infection of the finger.   He had multiple vesicles on the finger, which led to the diagnosis of herpetic whitlow, which we confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing.   Herpetic whitlow is an acute viral infection of the hand caused by either herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 or 2.  Its characteristic findings are significant pain and erythema with overlying nonpurulent vesicles.  Herpetic whitlow, a herpes simplex virus infection involving the digits, most commonly presents as a vesicular eruption involving a single digit.  Herpetic whitlow is a herpes simplex virus infection of the finger.  Herpetic whitlow is a painful cutaneous infection that most commonly affects the distal phalanx of the fingers and occasionally the toes.  Herpetic whitlow may have a prodrome of burning, pruritus, and/or tingling of the affected finger or the entire limb, followed by erythema, pain, and vesicle formation.  UNLABELLED Herpetic whitlow is a herpes simplex virus type 1 or 2 infection of the fingers characterised by erythema and painful, non-purulent vesicles.  This paper describes a case of transmission of herpetic whitlow to the index finger of a dental student from a patient with herpes simplex virus.  UNLABELLED Herpetic whitlow is a herpes simplex virus type 1 or 2 infection of the fingers characterised by erythema and painful, non-purulent vesicles.

"[SOC]###context: Ang II treatment also led to a significant increment in intracellular reactive oxygen species generation, which could be fully abolished by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase inhibitors apocynin or diphenylene iodonium, indicating that Ang II enhanced oxidative stress via a NADPH oxidase-dependent manner.  NOX inhibitors (diphenylene iodonium (DPI) or apocynin) were able to achieve similar results to that of ML-7 except no effect on MLCK activity and MLC20 phosphorylation.   Significant reductions of AII effects on podocyte TRPC6 were also observed after pretreatment with NADPH oxidase inhibitors apocynin or diphenylene iodonium (DPI).   Furthermore, inhibition of NOX-mediated ROS production with apocynin, diphenylene iodonium (DPI) or NOX2 docking sequence (Nox2ds)-tat peptide during these first 4h of PE stimulation significantly inhibited PE-induced hypertrophy of H9c2 cells, both after 24 and 48h of PE stimulation.   Remarkably, Ang-II induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) via a NAD(P)H oxidase-dependent mechanism, as shown by inhibition of ROS production via the NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitors diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin.   Moreover, NADPH oxidase activation by beta CD (145. 5+/-9. 0%; control: 98. 6+/-1. 6%) was also abrogated by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors apocynin (100. 4+/-3. 2%) and diphenylene iodonium (9. 5+/-3. 3%).  We used structurally diverse NADPH oxidase inhibitors, aminoethyl-benzenesulfonylfluoride (AEBSF, 100-1000microM), apocynin (100-1000microM), and diphenylene iodonium (DPI, 3-30microM), to inhibit intrinsic NADPH oxidase activity in N27 cells.  Paraquat-induced ROS production was inhibited by NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin and diphenylene iodonium (DPI), but not the xanthine/xanthine oxidase inhibitor, allopurinol.  With the use of dihydroethidium as a superoxide indicator, C(2)-ceramide was found to increase superoxide production in the endothelial cells of small coronary arteries, which was inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors N-vanillylnonanamide, apocynin, and diphenylene iodonium.  The contractile responses to U46619 in isolated PA were inhibited by PEG-catalase and the NADPH oxidase inhibitors diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin.  The effects of diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin, inhibitors of NADPH oxidase, on key parameters of PSC activation were evaluated in vitro.  These effects could be inhibited by diphenylene iodonium and apocynin, indicating a self-cycle regulated by NADPH oxidase in microglial activation in response to oAâ.  Diphenylene iodonium is an inhibitor of the respiratory burst-generating NADPH oxidase of phagocytes.  NADPH oxidase inhibitors [diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-acetophenone)] prevented the microglial activation induced by oAâ, suggesting that NADPH oxidase activation was involved in microglial activation.  In addition, inhibitors of NADPH oxidase (diphenylene iodonium or apocynin) also prevented microglia proliferation, suggesting that this may be the source of hydrogen peroxide.  Inhibitors of NADPH oxidase (diphenylene iodonium, apocynin, D-(+)-neopterine) also significantly blunted the generation of reactive oxygen species, activation of K(+), Cl(-)-cotransport and apoptosis induced by N-ethylmaleimide.  With the use of dihydroethidium as a superoxide indicator, C(2)-ceramide was found to increase superoxide production in the endothelial cells of small coronary arteries, which was inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors N-vanillylnonanamide, apocynin, and diphenylene iodonium.  NADPH-dependent superoxide production by the solubilized oxidase of neutrophils was inhibited 36% by diphenylene iodonium at a 1:1 stoichiometry with the enzyme flavoprotein content.  These effects could be inhibited by diphenylene iodonium and apocynin, indicating a self-cycle regulated by NADPH oxidase in microglial activation in response to oAβ Moreover, CSE-regulated COX-2, PGE(2), and IL-6 generation was inhibited by pretreatment with TLR4 Ab; inhibitors of c-Src (PP1), NADPH oxidase (diphenylene iodonium chloride and apocynin), p38 MAPK (SB202190), MEK1/2 (U0126), JNK1/2 (SP600125), and NF-kappaB (helenalin); a ROS scavenger (N-acetyl-l-cysteine); and transfection with siRNA of TLR4, MyD88, TRAF6, Src, p47(phox), p38, p42, JNK2, or p65 Treatment of the cells with the NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin and diphenylene iodonium, inhibited these effects With the use of dihydroethidium as a superoxide indicator, C(2)-ceramide was found to increase superoxide production in the endothelial cells of small coronary arteries, which was inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors N-vanillylnonanamide, apocynin, and diphenylene iodonium UVB irradiation generated ROS in a dose-dependent manner, and this was significantly inhibited by diphenylene iodonium (DPI), apocynin (Apo) and neopterine (Neo), inhibitors of the NADPH oxidase, and indomethacin (Indo), a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, but not by the mitochondrial electron transport inhibitors and other cytosolic enzyme inhibitors In RBA-1 cells, JEV induced MMP-9 expression and promoter activity, which was inhibited by pretreatment with inhibitors of NADPH oxidase (diphenylene iodonium chloride or apocynin), MAPKs (U0126, SB203580 or SP600125) and a ROS scavenger (N-acetylcysteine), or transfection with siRNAs of p47(phox) , ERK1, JNK2 and p38 Such discharge of Dectin-1-reactive β-glucan from macrophage cells was inhibited by either NADPH oxidase inhibitors (apocynin and diphenylene iodonium) or radical scavengers (N-acetyl cysteine and MCI-186) The contractile responses to U46619 in isolated PA were inhibited by PEG-catalase and the NADPH oxidase inhibitors diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin ANG II further increased superoxide production in LP only, and this was inhibited by coincubation with diphenylene iodonium or apocynin (inhibitor of NADPH oxidase complex) Our results showed that IL-1beta enhanced HTSMCs-monocyte adhesion through up-regulation of VCAM-1, which was inhibited by pretreatment with selective inhibitors of PKCalpha (Gö6976), c-Src (PP1), NADPH oxidase [diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin (APO)], intracellular calcium chelator (BAPTA/AM), PI-PLC (U73122), CaM (calmidazolium chloride), CaM kinase II (KN62), p300 (garcinol), NF-kappaB (Bay11-7082), HDAC (trichostatin A), and ROS scavenger [N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC)] or transfection with siRNAs of MyD88, PKCalpha, Src, p47(phox), p300, and HDAC4.  Here we show that cAMP-dependent decidualization can be attenuated or enhanced upon treatment of primary cultures with a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase inhibitor (diphenylen iodonium) or activator (apocynin), respectively.   With the use of dihydroethidium as a superoxide indicator, C(2)-ceramide was found to increase superoxide production in the endothelial cells of small coronary arteries, which was inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors N-vanillylnonanamide, apocynin, and diphenylene iodonium.   The inhibition of NAD(P)H oxidase by apocynin and diphenylene iodonium, and of the mitochondrial electron transport system at complex II by thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA), significantly inhibited both AGE-induced ROS production and VCAM-1 expression, whereas these effects were potentiated by rotenone and antimycin A, specific inhibitors of mitochondrial complex I and III, respectively.   Paraquat-induced ROS production was inhibited by NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin and diphenylene iodonium (DPI), but not the xanthine/xanthine oxidase inhibitor, allopurinol.   Treatment of the cells with the NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin and diphenylene iodonium, inhibited these effects.   The G6PD inhibitor DHEA and the inhibitors of NADPH oxidase apocynin and diphenylene iodonium (DPI) prevented both superoxide generation and capacitation in human spermatozoa, but whereas DPI and DHEA inhibited PPP, apocynin did not influence it, suggesting that PPP activation during capacitation is not a response to increased oxidative stress but exerts a role by supplying reducing equivalents to oxygen.  Ang II induced a time-dependent increase in Rac1 activation and O(2)(*-) production in Neuro-2A cells, and this was abolished by pretreatment with AdN17Rac1 or the NADPH oxidase inhibitors apocynin or diphenylene iodonium.   Paraquat-induced ROS production was inhibited by NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin and diphenylene iodonium (DPI), but not the xanthine/xanthine oxidase inhibitor, allopurinol.  In RBA-1 cells, JEV induced MMP-9 expression and promoter activity, which was inhibited by pretreatment with inhibitors of NADPH oxidase (diphenylene iodonium chloride or apocynin), MAPKs (U0126, SB203580 or SP600125) and a ROS scavenger (N-acetylcysteine), or transfection with siRNAs of p47(phox) , ERK1, JNK2 and p38.  These effects could be inhibited by diphenylene iodonium and apocynin, indicating a self-cycle regulated by NADPH oxidase in microglial activation in response to oAβ.  Treatment of the cells with the NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin and diphenylene iodonium, inhibited these effects.  UVB irradiation generated ROS in a dose-dependent manner, and this was significantly inhibited by diphenylene iodonium (DPI), apocynin (Apo) and neopterine (Neo), inhibitors of the NADPH oxidase, and indomethacin (Indo), a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, but not by the mitochondrial electron transport inhibitors and other cytosolic enzyme inhibitors.  Such discharge of Dectin-1-reactive β-glucan from macrophage cells was inhibited by either NADPH oxidase inhibitors (apocynin and diphenylene iodonium) or radical scavengers (N-acetyl cysteine and MCI-186).  Our results showed that IL-1beta enhanced HTSMCs-monocyte adhesion through up-regulation of VCAM-1, which was inhibited by pretreatment with selective inhibitors of PKCalpha (Gö6976), c-Src (PP1), NADPH oxidase [diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin (APO)], intracellular calcium chelator (BAPTA/AM), PI-PLC (U73122), CaM (calmidazolium chloride), CaM kinase II (KN62), p300 (garcinol), NF-kappaB (Bay11-7082), HDAC (trichostatin A), and ROS scavenger [N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC)] or transfection w Moreover, CSE-regulated COX-2, PGE(2), and IL-6 generation was inhibited by pretreatment with TLR4 Ab; inhibitors of c-Src (PP1), NADPH oxidase (diphenylene iodonium chloride and apocynin), p38 MAPK (SB202190), MEK1/2 (U0126), JNK1/2 (SP600125), and NF-kappaB (helenalin); a ROS scavenger (N-acetyl-l-cysteine); and transfection with siRNA of TLR4, MyD88, TRAF6, Src, p47(phox), p38, p42, JNK2, or p65.  The use of diphenylene iodonium, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, to investigate the antimicrobial action of human monocyte derived macrophages.  NADPH oxidase inhibitors [diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-acetophenone)] prevented the microglial activation induced by oAβ, suggesting that NADPH oxidase activation was involved in microglial activation.  Furthermore, inhibition of NOX-mediated ROS production with apocynin, diphenylene iodonium (DPI) or NOX2 docking sequence (Nox2ds)-tat peptide during these first 4h of PE stimulation significantly inhibited PE-induced hypertrophy of H9c2 cells, both after 24 and 48h of PE stimulation.  We compared the pharmacological profiles of the commonly used NADPH oxidase inhibitors, diphenylene iodonium (DPI), apocynin and 4-(2-amino-ethyl)-benzolsulphonyl-fluoride (AEBSF), as well as the novel triazolo pyrimidine VAS3947.  IL-1beta and TNF-alpha rapidly stimulated the rate of hydrogen peroxide produced by isolated microglia, and this was inhibited by diphenylene iodonium, implying that the cytokines were acting directly on microglia to stimulate the NADPH oxidase.  The fractions achieved the same effects that known NADPH oxidase inhibitors, such as diphenylene iodonium and apocynin, but they presented better hydrosolubility.  Ang II induced a time-dependent increase in Rac1 activation and O(2)(*-) production in Neuro-2A cells, and this was abolished by pretreatment with AdN17Rac1 or the NADPH oxidase inhibitors apocynin or diphenylene iodonium.

"[SOC]###context: The calcium channel blocker verapamil is the drug of choice for CH prevention.  Other drugs that may be used for this purpose include lithium carbonate, topiramate, valproic acid, gabapentin, and baclofen.  Recently, the therapeutic options for refractory CH patients have expanded with the emergence of both peripheral (mostly occipital nerve) and central (hypothalamic) neurostimulation.  With the emergence of these novel treatments, the role of ablative surgery in CH has declined.  The mainstay of prophylactic therapy is verapamil.  Yet, other medications, including lithium, divalproex sodium, topiramate, methysergide, gabapentin, and even indomethacin, may be useful when the headache fails to respond to verapamil.  For medically refractory patients, surgical interventions, occipital nerve stimulation, and deep brain stimulation remain an option.  The objective of this open single-centre study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of botulinum toxin type-A (BTX-A) as add-on in the prophylactic treatment of cluster headache (CH).  These findings provide evidence that BTX-A may be beneficial as an add-on prophylactic therapy for a limited number of patients with chronic CH.  There are a variety of different medications for abortive and prophylactic therapy, accompanied by a variable amount of evidence-based medicine.  Most procedures are directed against the sensory trigeminal nerve and associated ganglia, eg, anesthetizing the sphenopalatine ganglion.  The mainstay of prophylactic therapy is verapamil.  Lithium, divalproex sodium, or topiramate may also be useful.  Based on our clinical experience, we recommended the combination of nasal sumatriptan for acute attacks and verapamil 240 mg/day for prophylaxis.  Topiramate also appears to be well tolerated and useful in the adjunctive treatment of cluster headache.  The cornerstone of maintenance prophylaxis is verapamil, yet methysergide, lithium, and divalproex sodium may also be employed.  In some patients, melatonin or topiramate may be useful adjunctive therapies.  Prophylactic therapy in most cases consisted of verapamil, also with a good response.  Patients with chronic cluster headache may achieve good results from long-term treatment with other therapies, including lithium carbonate, verapamil, and ketoprofen. 
###question: What pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions can be considered as prophylactic therapies in Cluster Headache patients?[EOC] [SOR]###response: Verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, is considered the mainstay of prophylactic therapy of Cluster Headache patients.

"[SOC]###context: ver the last few years, advances in methodology have made it possible to recover peptides from FFPE tissues that yield a reasonable representation of the proteins recovered from identical fresh or frozen specimens.  Thus, laser capture microdissection of FFPE tissue coupled with downstream proteomic analysis is a valid approach Qualitative proteome profiling of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue is advancing the field of clinical proteomics.  Recent improvements in proteomics technologies, from the 2D gel analysis of intact proteins to the ""shotgun"" quantification of peptides and the use of isobaric tags for absolute and relative quantification (iTRAQ) method, have made the analysis of FFPE tissues possible.  The ability to investigate the proteome of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues can be considered a major recent achievement in the field of clinical proteomics.  The label-free approach enables the quantitative measurement of radiation-induced alterations in FFPE tissue and facilitates retrospective biomarker identification using clinical archives.  Proteomic analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded pancreatic tissue using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.  We report that differentially expressed proteins can be identified among FFPE tissue specimens originating from individuals with different pancreatic histologic findings.  Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) proteome analysis using gel-free and gel-based proteomics.  This study will facilitate the development of future proteomic analysis of FFPE tissue and provide a tool for the validation in archival samples of biomarkers of exposure, prognosis and disease.  The CAAR method presented here complements previously described antigen-retrieval protocols and is an important step in being able to fully analyze the proteome of archived FFPE tissue.  Proteome, phosphoproteome, and N-glycoproteome are quantitatively preserved in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue and analyzable by high-resolution mass spectrometry.  It has only recently been shown that proteins in FFPE tissues can be identified by mass spectrometry-based proteomics but analysis of post-translational modifications is thought to be difficult or impossible Results from the FFPE-FASP procedure do not indicate any discernible changes due to storage time, hematoxylin staining or laser capture microdissection.  Thus, FFPE biobank material can be analyzed by quantitative proteomics at the level of proteins and post-translational modifications.  A novel tissue microdissection technique has been developed and combined with a method to extract soluble peptides directly from FFPE tissue for mass spectral analysis of prostate cancer (PCa) and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH).  Hundreds of proteins from PCa and BPH tissue were identified, espite using tissue blocks stored for as many as 28 years, high confidence and comparative proteome analysis between the leiomyomas and the sarcoma is achieved.  These findings demonstrate that formalin fixation, paraffin processing, and LCM do not negatively impact protein quality and quantity as determined by MS and that FFPE samples are amenable to global proteomic analysis.  Protein extraction of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue enables robust proteomic profiles by mass spectrometry.

"[SOC]###context: DITPA normalized the elevated serum T(3) and TSH when the dose reached 1 mg/kg · d and T(4) and rT(3) increased to the lower normal range.  The identification of 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) that binds to both α- and β-type TRs with relatively low affinity was unique in that this analog improves left ventricular function in heart failure as well as lowers cholesterol.  Treatment with DITPA attenuates the acute inflammatory response and reduces myocardial infarct size.  Thus DITPA administration impairs baseline cardiac parameters in mice and can be fatal during in vivo acute myocardial I/R.  DITPA improved some hemodynamic and metabolic parameters, but there was no evidence for symptomatic benefit in congestive heart failure The results suggested that DITPA can promote a healthy vasculature independently from its thyroid-related metabolic effects.    Moreover, DITPA and T(4) were efficacious in preventing effects of hypothyroidism on cardiac function and BVD Both T4 and DITPA had beneficial effects on chamber remodeling, which was most likely due to beneficial changes in cell shape and improved vascular supply.  The thyroid analog DITPA enhances endothelial nitric oxide and beta-adrenergic-mediated vasorelaxation by increasing nitric oxide in the vasculature.

"[SOC]###context: We obtained serial hematopoietic samples from an SCN patient who developed AML 17 years after the initiation of G-CSF treatment.  Next- generation sequencing was performed to identify mutations during disease progression.  In the AML phase, we found 12 acquired nonsynonymous mutations.  Three of these, in CSF3R, LLGL2, and ZC3H18, co-occurred in a subpopulation of progenitor cells already in the early SCN phase.  This population expanded over time, whereas clones harboring only CSF3R mutations disappeared from the BM.  The other 9 mutations were only apparent in the AML cells and affected known AML-associated genes (RUNX1 and ASXL1) and chromatin remodelers (SUZ12 and EP300).  In addition, a novel CSF3R mutation that conferred autonomous proliferation to myeloid progenitors was found.  We conclude that progression from SCN to AML is a multistep process, with distinct mutations arising early during the SCN phase and others later in AML development.  The sequential gain of 2 CSF3R mutations implicates abnormal G-CSF signaling as a driver of leukemic transformation in this case of SCN This chapter focuses on cyclic and congenital neutropenia, two very interesting and rare hematological conditions causing severe chronic neutropenia.  Both disorders respond well to treatment with the myeloid growth factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) Treatment with G-CSF is usually effective, but the dose of G-CSF required to normalize blood neutrophils varies greatly.  Ten to thirty percent of severe congenital neutropenia patients evolve to develop acute myeloid leukemia, necessitating careful clinical monitoring.  In severe congenital neutropenia (SCN), long-term therapy with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has reduced mortality from sepsis, revealing an underlying predisposition to myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia (MDS/AML) Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) therapy has significantly reduced the frequency and severity of infections, but its possible influence on the risk of malignancy is not known No septic deaths occurred during G-CSF therapy.  Thirteen cases of MDS/AL were recorded.  The cumulative incidence of MDS/AL was 2. 7% (SD 1. 3%) at 10 years and 8. 1% (SD 2. 7%) at 20 years Owing to their particular susceptibility to infections, patients with severe congenital neutropenia had the strongest exposure to G-CSF; the risk of leukemia increased with the degree of G-CSF exposure in this subgroup Stable long-term risk of leukaemia in patients with severe congenital neutropenia maintained on G-CSF therapy.  This specifically applies to children with severe congenital neutropenia who receive lifelong treatment with G-CSF and in which the high susceptibility to develop MDS and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has now become a major clinical concern.  Owing to their particular susceptibility to infections, patients with severe congenital neutropenia had the strongest exposure to G-CSF; the risk of leukemia increased with the degree of G-CSF exposure in this subgroup.  As of January 1, 2000, myelodysplasia (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) has occurred in 35 of 387 patients with congenital neutropenia with a cumulative risk of 13% after 8 years of G-CSF treatment

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the usefulness of the Salzburg Consensus Criteria (SCC) for determining the prognosis of critically ill patients with nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE).  CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings suggest that SCC is highly compatible with clinical practice in the decision for treatment of patients with NCSE.

Diagnostic accuracy of the Salzburg EEG criteria for non-convulsive status epilepticus: a retrospective study.  BACKGROUND: Several EEG criteria have been proposed for diagnosis of non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), but none have been clinically validated.  We aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the EEG criteria proposed by a panel of experts at the fourth London-Innsbruck Colloquium on Status Epilepticus in Salzburg, 2013 (henceforth called the Salzburg criteria).  Two raters blinded to all other patient data retrospectively analysed the EEG recordings and, using the Salzburg criteria, categorised patients as in NCSE or not in NCSE.

Newer agents such as angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor, sildenafil, and ivabradine have demonstrated benefits without improving mortality.  In db/db, a model of HFPEF, selective HR reduction by If-inhibition improved vascular stiffness, LV contractility, and diastolic function.  Therefore, If-inhibition might be a therapeutic concept for HFPEF, if confirmed in humans.  Selective HR reduction with IVA reduces DD and cardiac fibrosis in hypercholesterolemic rabbits.  These beneficial effects of IVA support testing pure HR reduction in patients with diastolic heart failure.  Beside its use in therapy of coronary artery disease, I(f)-channel inhibition potentially exhibits beneficial effects in systolic and diastolic heart failure as well.  In patients with HFpEF, short-term treatment with ivabradine increased exercise capacity, with a contribution from improved left ventricular filling pressure response to exercise as reflected by the ratio of peak early diastolic mitral flow velocity to peak early diastolic mitral annular velocity. 
###question: What is the effect of ivabradine in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction?[EOC] [SOR]###response: I(f)-channel inhibition potentially exhibits beneficial effects in diastolic heart failure.   In patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), short-term treatment with ivabradine increased exercise capacity, with a contribution from improved left ventricular filling pressure response to exercise as reflected by the ratio of peak early diastolic mitral flow velocity to peak early diastolic mitral annular velocity.   Ivabradine has demonstrated benefits in HFpEF without improving mortality. 	In db/db, a model of HFpEF, ivabradine improved vascular stiffness, left ventricular contractility, and diastolic function.  Furthermore, ivabradine reduces cardiac fibrosis in hypercholesterolemic rabbits. [EOR]"

"[SOC]###context: HLA-B∗15:02 is known as a biomarker for carbamazepine (CBZ) induced Steven-Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (SJS/TEN) in some Asian populations.  Hence United States Federal Drug Administration (USFDA) recommends HLA-B∗15:02 screening for Asian and other populations with a high prevalence of HLA-B∗15:02, prior to the administration of carbamazepine.
