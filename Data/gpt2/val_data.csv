"[SOC]###context: Although macroH2A1 nucleosomes are widely distributed across the genome, their local concentration varies over a range of 100-fold or more The transcribed regions of most active genes are depleted of macroH2A1, often in sharply localized domains that show depletion of 4-fold or more relative to bulk mouse liver chromatin This repressor activity is further supported by the substantial and relatively uniform macroH2A1 enrichment along the inactive X chromosome, which averages 4-fold mH2A1 consistently colocalizes with a heterochromatin marker (H3K27me2; histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 27) and mH2A2 with a euchromatin marker (H3K4me3; histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4) Similar results were found for the L41gene, with enrichment of mH2A in the promoter region.  By using highly specific antibodies against mH2A1 and stable HEK 293 cell lines expressing either green fluorescent protein (GFP)-mH2A1 or GFP-H2A, we found that the Xi chromosome contains approximately 1. 5-fold more mH2A1 than the autosomes The data show that mH2A1 is uniformly distributed across the entire Xi chromosome.  Interestingly, a stronger mH2A1 enrichment along the pseudoautosomal X chromosome region was observed in both sexes.  macroH2A1 nucleosomes were enriched on endogenous MLVs, with the highest enrichment occurring on the 5' end of pro-pol macroH2A1 is enriched on the inactive X chromosome in female mammalian cells, where it functions to maintain gene silencing.  We found that macroH2A1 was depleted on the transcribed regions of active genes In contrast, macroH2A1 was concentrated on the inactive X chromosome, consistent with our previous immunofluorescence studies.  These results support the hypothesis that macroH2As function as transcriptional repressors Taking into account the properties of macroH2A toward chromatin structure and dynamics and its role in gene repression our data suggest that the increased expression of macroH2A and the hypermethylation of DNA which occurs upon winter-acclimatization plays a major role for the reorganization of chromatin structure and the regulation of gene expression during the physiological adaptation to a colder environment Inactivation is a multistep process that involves a large non-coding RNA termed XIST, a variety of epigenetic modifications of chromatin, and alterations in protein composition such as enrichment of the histone variant macroH2A One of several features acquired by chromatin of the inactive X chromosome (Xi) is enrichment for the core histone H2A variant macroH2A within a distinct nuclear structure referred to as a macrochromatin body (MCB) In addition to localizing to the MCB, macroH2A accumulates at a perinuclear structure centered at the centrosome The centrosomal pool of macroH2A1 accumulates in the presence of an inhibitor of the 20S proteasome.  Although the MCB dissipates during late S phase and G2 before reforming in late G1, macroH2A1 remains associated during mitosis with specific regions of the Xi, including at the X inactivation center
###question: In which genomic positions is the histone variant macroH2A enriched?[EOC] [SOR]###response: macroH2A1 is enriched on the inactive X chromosome in female mammalian cells, where it functions to maintain gene silencing.  The transcribed regions of most active genes are depleted of macroH2A, often in sharply localized domains that show depletion of 4-fold or more relative to bulk mouse liver chromatin.  This repressor activity of marcroH2A is further supported by the substantial and relatively uniform macroH2A1 enrichment along the inactive X chromosome, which averages 4-fold.  In addition to localizing to the MCB, macroH2A accumulates at a perinuclear structure centered at the centrosome[EOR]"
"[SOC]###context: A human genetic variant (Ser96Ala) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) histidine-rich Ca(2+)-binding (HRC) protein has been linked to ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death in dilated cardiomyopathy.   These findings suggest that aberrant SR Ca2+ release and increased susceptibility to delayed afterdepolarizations underlie triggered arrhythmic activity in human Ala96 HRC carriers.  The histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) Ser96Ala polymorphism was shown to correlate with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death only in dilated cardiomyopathy patients but not in healthy human carriers.  These findings indicate that the HRC Ser96Ala variant increases the propensity of arrhythmogenic Ca(2+) waves in the stressed failing heart, suggesting a link between this genetic variant and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in human carriers.  HRC plays an important role in myocyte differentiation and in antiapoptotic cardioprotection against ischemia/reperfusion induced cardiac injury.  Interestingly, HRC has been linked with familiar cardiac conduction disease and an HRC polymorphism was shown to associate with malignant ventricular arrhythmias in the background of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.  This review summarizes studies, which have established the critical role of HRC in Ca(2+)-homeostasis, suggesting its importance in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology.  HRC is a SR luminal Ca(2+) binding protein known to associate with both triadin and the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase, and may thus mediate the crosstalk between SR Ca(2+) uptake and release.  Indeed, evidence from genetic models of JCN and HRC indicate that they are important in cardiophysiology as alterations in these proteins affect SR Ca(2+) handling and cardiac function.  In addition, downregulation of JCN and HRC may contribute to Ca(2+) cycling perturbations manifest in the failing heart, where their protein levels are significantly reduced.  The Ser96Ala genetic variant of HRC is associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in idiopathic DCM and may serve as an independent predictor of susceptibility to arrhythmogenesis in the setting of DCM.  AAV-mediated knock-down of HRC exacerbates transverse aorta constriction-induced heart failure.  Chronic overexpression of HRC that may disrupt intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis is implicated in pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy Ablation of HRC showed relatively normal phenotypes under basal condition, but exhibited a significantly increased susceptibility to isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy Our results present evidence that down-regulation of HRC could deteriorate cardiac function in TAC-FH through perturbed SR-mediated Ca(2+) cycling However, AAV9-mediated HRC-KD in TAC-FH was associated with decreased fractional shortening and increased cardiac fibrosis compared with control.  Histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) is a high capacity, low affinity Ca(2+) binding protein, specifically expressed in striated muscles of mammals.  In rabbit skeletal and cardiac muscles, HRC binds to sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes via triadin, a junctional SR protein.  Recently, a potential role in heart failure and arrhythmogenesis has been assigned to HRC due to its activity as regulator of SR Ca(2+) uptake and Ca(2+) release.  In addition, HRC null mice displayed a significantly exaggerated response to the induction of cardiac hypertrophy by isoproterenol compared to their wild-type littermates.  The exaggerated response of HRC knockout mice to the induction of cardiac hypertrophy is consistent with a regulatory role for HRCBP in calcium handling in vivo and suggests that mutations in HRC, in combination with other genetic or environmental factors, might contribute to pathological hypertrophy and heart failure.  We observed that the levels of HRC were reduced in animal models and human heart failure.  Collectively, these data indicate that alterations in expression levels of HRC are associated with impaired cardiac SR Ca homeostasis and contractile function.  Abnormal calcium cycling and cardiac arrhythmias associated with the human Ser96Ala genetic variant of histidine-rich calcium-binding protein.  The Ser96Ala variant in histidine-rich calcium-binding protein is associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.  Interestingly, HRC has been linked with familiar cardiac conduction disease and an HRC polymorphism was shown to associate with malignant ventricular arrhythmias in the background of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy

TFII-I has been implicated in neuronal and immunologic diseases as well as in thymic epithelial cancer.  Williams-Beuren Syndrome (WBS) is caused by a large hemizygous deletion on chromosome 7q11. 23 which encompasses 26-28 genes, including GTF2I, the human gene encoding TFII-I.  A subset of WBS patients has recently been shown to present with macrocytosis, a mild anemia characterized by enlarged erythrocytes.  We conditionally deleted the TFII-I/Gtf2i gene in adult mice by tamoxifen induced Cre-recombination.  Bone marrow cells revealed defects in erythro-megakaryopoiesis and an increase in expression of the adult β-globin gene.  The data show that TFII-I acts as a repressor of β-globin gene transcription and that it is implicated in the differentiation of erythro-megakaryocytic cells. 
###question: Is there a role for TFII-I in megakaryopoiesis?[EOC] [SOR]###response: Yes.  TFII-I acts as a repressor of β-globin gene transcription and is implicated in the differentiation of erythrocytes into megakaryopoiesis.   Mutations in exon 2 interfere with the synthesis of the full-length isoform of TF II-I and lead to the production of a shortened isoform, TFII, in erythroid cells.

"[SOC]###context: On the LCV, AnkB triggers docking of K(48)-linked polyubiquitinated proteins that are degraded by the host proteasomes to elevate cellular levels of amino acids needed for intracellular proliferation.   Transcription and injection of ankB is triggered by attached extracellular bacteria followed by rapid farnesylation and anchoring of AnkB to the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane beneath bacterial attachment, where K(48)-linked polyubiquitinated proteins are assembled and degraded by the proteasomes, leading to a rapid rise in the cellular levels of amino acids.  Although it has been known for a long time that ubiquitylation has a major role in the activation and regulation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway, recent studies have revealed that the picture is a lot more complex than originally thought.  NF-κB and ubiquitylation initially became linked when it was recognised that lysine (K)48-linked ubiquitin chains are involved in the processing of NF-κB precursors and the degradation of inhibitor of kappa B (IκB) proteins.   The proteasome, which identifies and destroys unwanted proteins rapidly, plays a vital role in maintaining cellular protein homeostasis.  Proteins that are destined for proteasome-mediated degradation are usually tagged with a chain of ubiquitin linked via lysine (K) 48 that targets them to the proteolytic machinery.   Covalent and reversible post-translational modifications of proteins are a common theme in signaling.  Ubiquitin conjugation was originally described to target proteins to proteasomal degradation by ubiquitin polymerization involving lysine (K) 48 residues.  Proteins tagged with lysine (Lys, K) 48 polyubiquitins chains are destined for degradation by the 26S proteasomal system.  Ubiquitination is best known for its role in targeting proteins for degradation by the proteasome, but evidence of the nonproteolytic functions of ubiquitin is also rapidly accumulating.  One example of the regulatory, rather than proteolytic, function of ubiquitin is provided by study of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins, which function as ubiquitin ligases to synthesize lysine 63 (K(63))-linked polyubiquitin chains to mediate protein kinase activation through a proteasome-independent mechanism.  Indeed, the TRAF2-interacting protein RIP can mediate IKK activation when it is modified by K(63) polyubiquitin chains, but is targeted to degradation by the proteasome when it is K(48)-polyubiquitinted by the NF-kappaB inhibitor A20.  NF-κB and ubiquitylation initially became linked when it was recognised that lysine (K)48-linked ubiquitin chains are involved in the processing of NF-κB precursors and the degradation of inhibitor of kappa B (IκB) proteins NF-κB and ubiquitylation initially became linked when it was recognised that lysine (K)48-linked ubiquitin chains are involved in the processing of NF-κB precursors and the degradation of inhibitor of kappa B (IκB) proteins Proteins that are destined for proteasome-mediated degradation are usually tagged with a chain of ubiquitin linked via lysine (K) 48 that targets them to the proteolytic machinery

Here, we investigated metabolic effects of the novel non-steroidal MRA finerenone (FIN) in a mouse model of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and the signaling pathways activated by MR antagonism at level of interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT).  OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of aldosterone antagonists (selective (eplerenone), non-selective (spironolactone or canrenone), or non-steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonists (finerenone)) in adults who have CKD with proteinuria (nephrotic and non-nephrotic range) on: patient-centred endpoints including kidney failure (previously know as end-stage kidney disease (ESKD)), major cardiovascular events, and death (any cause); kidney function (proteinuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and doubling of serum creatinine); blood pressure; and adverse events (including hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury, and gynaecomastia).  For example, the novel nonsteroidal MRA finerenone has a balanced distribution between the heart and kidney compared with spironolactone, which is preferentially concentrated in the kidneys.  Other nonsteroidal MRA such as apararenone, finerenone, AZD9977, and LY2623091 are in different clinical trials in patients with hypertension suffering from renal or hepatic fibrotic diseases.  (-)-Finerenone is a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist currently in phase III clinical trials for the treatment of chronic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes.   Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists: a Comprehensive Review of Finerenone.  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We aim to review the mechanism of action and safety profile of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) and discuss the differences between selective and non-selective MRAs.  More specifically, finerenone is a new medication that is currently under investigation for its promising cardiovascular and nephrological effects.   A new selective MRA named finerenone (originally BAY 94-8862) has shown promising results in several trials (ARTS-HF and ARTS-DN) and smaller studies.  Finerenone may have a dose-dependent benefit over older MRAs, decreasing rates of albuminuria and levels of BNP and NT-ProBNP without causing a significant increase in serum potassium levels.  Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism by finerenone is sufficient to improve function in preclinical muscular dystrophy.  The non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone prevents cardiac fibrotic remodeling.  A mouse model of cardiac fibrosis induced by short-term isoproterenol injection was used to compare the nonsteroidal MRA finerenone and the steroidal MRA eplerenone in equi-efficient systemic MR blocking dosages.

Nonsteroidal Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonist Finerenone Protects Against Acute Kidney Injury-Mediated Chronic Kidney Disease: Role of Oxidative Stress.  Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism has shown to be helpful against renal IR consequences; however, the potential benefit of novel nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists such as finerenone has to be further explored.  The Munich Wistar Frömter (MWF) rat is a model of chronic kidney disease (CKD), which exhibits endothelial dysfunction associated to low nitric oxide availability.  We hypothesize that the new highly selective, non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist, finerenone, reverses both endothelial dysfunction and microalbuminuria.   OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of different oral doses of the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone, given for 90 days to patients with diabetes and high or very high albuminuria who are receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker.  Two months after coronary artery ligation causing MI, mice with VSMC-specific MR deletion (MI-MR(SMKO)) and mice treated with the MR antagonist finerenone (MI-fine) had improved left ventricular compliance and elastance when compared with infarcted control mice (MI-CTL), as well as reduced interstitial fibrosis.  Importantly, the coronary reserve assessed by magnetic resonance imaging was preserved (difference in myocardial perfusion before and after induction of vasodilatation, mL mg(-1) min(-1): MI-CTL: 1. 1 ± 0. 5, nonsignificant; MI-MR(SMKO): 4. 6 ± 1. 6 [P<0. 05]; MI-fine: 3. 6 ± 0. 7 [P<0. 01]).  AIMS: To investigate the safety and potential efficacy of the novel non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone in patients with worsening chronic heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF) and at high risk of hyperkalaemia and worsening renal dysfunction.  Finerenone : third-generation mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist for the treatment of heart failure and diabetic kidney disease.  Finerenone is a novel nonsteroidal MRA, with higher selectivity toward the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) compared to spironolactone and stronger MR-binding affinity than eplerenone.  Recently, finerenone (BAY 94-8862) has emerged as a next-generation non-steroidal dihydropyridine-based MR antagonist designed to minimize off-target effects while maintaining potent efficacy.

"[SOC]###context: Amplification of MET has been reported in approximately 5%-22% of lung tumors with acquired resistance to small-molecule inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).  Resistance to EGFR inhibitors is likely mediated through downstream activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase /AKT pathway.  Simultaneous treatment of resistant tumors with a MET inhibitor plus an EGFR inhibitor can abrogate activation of downstream effectors of cell growth, proliferation, and survival, thereby overcoming acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors.  HGF mediated both ERK and Akt phosphorylation.  ERK/Akt signaling, but not the Smad pathway, may be one of the main processes in HGF-induced EMT, The MAPK/Akt pathway is indispensable in HGF/c-Met signaling.  Inhibition of c-Met activation sensitizes osteosarcoma cells to cisplatin via suppression of the PI3K-Akt signaling Specifically, we demonstrated that inhibition of c-Met activity led to suppression of the PI3K-Akt pathway, thus enhancing cisplatin chemosensitivity.  Our study clearly suggests that inhibition of c-Met activity can effectively sensitize osteosarcoma cells to cisplatin via suppression of the PI3K-Akt signaling.  We found that a dual Met/VEGF receptor 2 kinase inhibitor, E7050, circumvented HGF-induced EGFR-TKI resistance in EGFR mutant lung cancer cell lines by inhibiting the Met/Gab1/PI3K/Akt pathway in vitro.  Here, we report that i) treatment of RL95-2 cells with HGF resulted in phosphorylation of the HGF receptor c-Met, activation of Akt and IκB, translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus, and up-regulation of COX-2 mRNA; Our data suggest that HGF possesses chemotactic ability, has anti-apoptosis action, and induces cellular infiltration via the PI3K/Akt pathway; Hepatocyte growth factor-induced c-Src-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin pathway inhibits dendritic cell activation by blocking IκB kinase activity Activation of c-Src in turn establishes a complex consisting of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and c-MET, and promotes downstream activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway and mammalian target of rapamycin.  Notably, hepatocyte growth factor-stimulated c-Src activation results in induction of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complexes p85α/p110α and p85α/p110δ, which is required for activation of mammalian target of rapamycin, and consequent inhibition of IκB kinase and nuclear factor-κB activation.  Our findings, for the first time, have identified the c-Src-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin pathway that plays a pivotal role in mediating the inhibitory effects of hepatocyte growth factor on dendritic cell activation by blocking nuclear factor-κB signaling.  Cyr61 siRNA inhibited a second phase of Akt phosphorylation measured 12 hours after cell stimulation with HGF and also inhibited HGF-induced phosphorylation of the Akt target glycogen synthase kinase 3alpha.  HGF+EGF treatment increased the duration of ERK1/2 and AKT activation compared to HGF or EGF alone.  All these data indicate that a crosstalk between the EGF and HGF pathways in mammary epithelial cells may modulate the development of the mammary gland.  Hepatocyte growth factor and c-Met promote dendritic maturation during hippocampal neuron differentiation via the Akt pathway Consistent with these results, HGF activated Akt, which phosphorylates glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) to inactivate it, and reduced phosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), which can promote microtubule polymerization and dendrite elongation when dephosphorylated.  Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of c-Met with its specific inhibitor, PHA-665752, or genetic knock-down of c-Met with short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) suppressed HGF-induced phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3beta, increased phosphorylation of MAP2, and reduced dendrite number and length in cultured hippocampal neurons.  Inhibiting Akt activity with the phosphoinositide-3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 or Akt inhibitor X suppressed HGF-induced phosphorylation of GSK-3beta, increased MAP2 phosphorylation, and blocked the ability of HGF to enhance dendritic length.  These observations indicate that HGF and c-Met can regulate the early stages of dendrite maturation via activation of the Akt/GSK-3beta pathway.  Involvement of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in hepatocyte growth factor-induced migration of uveal melanoma cells HGF was found to enhance cell migration, and that HGF-induced migration depends on PI3K/Akt pathway.  The activation of PI3K/Akt pathway induced by the HGF/c-Met axis is involved in the downregulation of cell adhesion molecules E-cadherin and beta-catenin, contributing to the attenuation of cell-cell adhesion and promoting the enhanced motility and migration of uveal melanoma cells.  HGF protects cultured cortical neurons against hypoxia/reoxygenation induced cell injury via ERK1/2 and PI-3K/Akt pathways HGF stimulated both ERK1/2 and Akt activities in cortical neurons.  Inhibition of ERK activation completely abolished the protective effects of HGF, and inhibition of Akt activation reduced, but did not completely eliminate the HGF mediated neuroprotection.  It is suggested that the neuroprotection of HGF depend on ERK1/2 pathway, and, to a lesser extent, PI-3K/Akt pathway.   Met signals hepatocyte survival by preventing Fas-triggered FLIP degradation in a PI3k-Akt-dependent manner Thus, Met acting on PI3K and Akt ensures high levels of FLIPL, and disruption of this pathway contributes to hepatic apoptosis and possibly to Fas-related liver diseases.  The HGF-induced increase in Nkx 2. 5 expression was inhibited by co-treatment with the PI3 kinase inhibitors Wortmannin and LY294002, but not by its inactive homolog LY303511, suggesting an involvement of the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway in this effect.  X-Linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein expression level in colorectal cancer is regulated by hepatocyte growth factor/C-met pathway via Akt signaling Activation of XIAP expression by HGF was inhibited by siRNA targeting Akt1 and Akt2.  Activation of C-MET enhances XIAP through the Akt pathway.  Hepatocyte growth factor prevents ventricular remodeling and dysfunction in mice via Akt pathway and angiogenesis A significant reduction in apoptosis in the HGF-treated hearts was observed compared with control hearts, and was strongly associated with increased Akt activation.  The antiapoptotic effect of HGF was mediated by activation of PI3-kinase/Akt pathway.  The protective effect of HGF/SF against the ADR-induced apoptosis was abolished in the presence of either LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3'-OH kinase (PI3-K) or 1L-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol 2-(R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate, an inhibitor of Akt, thus implicating the activation of PI3-K-Akt signaling in the antiapoptotic action of HGF/SF.  Immunoblotting analysis revealed that HGF/SF stimulated the sustained phosphorylation of Akt for several hours Furthermore, ADR-induced activation of caspase-9, a downstream molecule of Akt, was inhibited for at least 24 h after HGF/SF stimulation, These results indicate that HGF/SF, but not EGF, transmitted protective signals against ADR-induced apoptosis by causing sustained activation of the PI3-K-Akt signaling pathway.  Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor inhibits UVB-induced apoptosis of human keratinocytes but not of keratinocyte-derived cell lines via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway When we analyzed the signaling pathways initiated by the HGF/SF receptor c-met, we found that the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and its downstream-element AKT and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase were activated.  Inhibition of PI 3-kinase led to a complete abrogation of the anti-apoptotic effect of HGF/SF, whereas blockade of the MAP kinase pathway had no effect.  We now show in detached cells a cooperative effect of HGF and FN in the activation of PI 3-kinase and on the phosphorylation of PKB/Akt at serine 473.  PI 3-kinase activity is also required for the HGF- and fibronectin-induced survival responses, as well as anchorage-independent colony growth.  Together, these results demonstrate that the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway is a key effector of the HGF- and fibronectin-induced survival response of breast carcinoma cells under detached conditions and corroborate an interaction between integrin and HGF/ Met signalling pathways in the development of invasive breast cancer. 
###question: Is c-met involved in the activation of the Akt pathway?[EOC] [SOR]###response: HGF-induced activation of c-Met is playing a pivotal role in the stimulation of c-Src activation, resulting in induction of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complexes p85α/p110α and p85α/p110δ, which is required for Akt-mediated activation of mammalian target of rapamycin, with consequent inhibition of IκB kinase and nuclear factor-κB activation, resulting in enhanced cell survival.

"[SOC]###context: Spermidine protects against α-synuclein neurotoxicity.  Here, we show that administration of the naturally occurring polyamine spermidine, which declines continuously during aging in various species, alleviates a series of PD-related degenerative processes in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, two established model systems for PD pathology.  In the fruit fly, simple feeding with spermidine inhibited loss of climbing activity and early organismal death upon heterologous expression of human α-synuclein, which is thought to be the principal toxic trigger of PD.  In this line, administration of spermidine rescued α-synuclein-induced loss of dopaminergic neurons, a hallmark of PD, in nematodes.  Alleviation of PD-related neurodegeneration by spermidine was accompanied by induction of autophagy, suggesting that this cytoprotective process may be responsible for the beneficial effects of spermidine administration.

This finding suggests that increased levels of spermidine and potentially other polyamines can initiate the disease-related process of α-Syn.

"[SOC]###context: Tamoxifen might have a role in the initial treatment of high-grade gliomas and should be studied in future Phase II trials building on the newly established platform of concurrent chemoradiotherapy.  The addition of high-dose tamoxifen to standard radiotherapy does not improve the survival of patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.  In this study, in which tamoxifen was used in conjunction with radiotherapy, progression free survival was shown to be less good when compared with historical data HR = 3. 1 (CI: 1. 7-5. 7).  The addition of high-dose tamoxifen, although well tolerated, confers no clinical benefit to patients treated with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma treated with standard radiotherapy.  CONCLUSIONS: Carboplatin and high dose tamoxifen has similar response rates to other regimens for recurrent malignant gliomas and are probably equivalent to those found using tamoxifen as monotherapy.   CONCLUSIONS: Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin administered alone or in combination with tamoxifen is safe and moderately effective in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma.  Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors such as high-dose tamoxifen and hypericin also have been used in the treatment of malignant gliomas.   Considering these facts, polyethylene-glycol-liposomal doxorubicin with and without tamoxifen was evaluated within two sequential Phase II trials performed at our institution.   In a parallel phase-II-study investigating post-operative treatment with tamoxifen (TAM), carboplatin and radiation therapy for glioblastomas, 16 of 49 patients (33%) showed multifocal recurrence, which developed after a mean of 46 weeks, raising the question of an association with therapy.  Radiation therapy and high-dose tamoxifen in the treatment of patients with diffuse brainstem gliomas: results of a Brazilian cooperative study.  Brainstem Glioma Cooperative Group.  PURPOSE: The efficacy of radiation therapy (RT) combined with tamoxifen (TX) was tested in patients diagnosed with diffuse brainstem gliomas in a multicenter trial.  CONCLUSION: This treatment combination produced no significant change in the overall poor prognosis of these patients.  Most tumors responded initially to treatment but recurred as the study progressed.  A minority of patients seemed to benefit from the extended use of TX.   Tamoxifen, a protein kinase C inhibitor when administered in high dosages, is currently being used as an adjuvant in the treatment of patients with malignant gliomas.  We present a patient with a recurrent malignant glioma who was continued on high dose tamoxifen despite radiologic documented doubling of the tumor size and who eventually showed a delayed response to this agent nine months after initiation of treatment.

"[SOC]###context: antifungal protein KP4 Killer protein 4 (KP4) is a well studied viral toxin secreted by the maize smut fungus Ustilago maydis that kills sensitive Ustilago strains as well as inhibits Fusarium and plant root growth by inhibiting calcium uptake.  Our previous work on a virally encoded fungal toxin, KP4, from Ustilago maydis and subsequently with the plant defensin, MsDef1, from Medicago sativa demonstrated that some of these proteins specifically blocked calcium channels in both fungi and animals.  The results presented here demonstrate that KP4 and three plant defensins, MsDef1, MtDef2, and RsAFP2, all inhibit root growth in germinating Arabidopsis seeds at low micromolar concentrations .  There are three well-characterized killer toxins in U.  maydis-KP1, KP4, and KP6-which are secreted by the P1, P4, and P6 subtypes, respectively.  These killer toxins are small polypeptides encoded by segments of an endogenous, persistent double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus in each U.  maydis subtype.  The viral gene for the killer protein 4 (KP4) has been explored for its antifungal effect antifungal protein KP4 from Ustilago maydis-infecting virus The antifungal activity correlated with the presence of the KP4 transgene.  These results suggest that KP4 may inhibit cell growth and division by blocking calcium-regulated signal transduction pathways.  KP4 is a virally encoded fungal toxin secreted by the P4 killer strain of Ustilago maydis.  KP4 is a virally encoded fungal toxin secreted by the P4 killer strain of Ustilago maydis.  Our results defining the type of mammalian channel affected by this fungal toxin further support our contention that KP4 inhibits fungal growth by blocking transmembrane calcium flux through fungal calcium channels, Killer toxins are polypeptides secreted by some fungal species that kill sensitive cells of the same or related species.  In the best-characterized cases, they function by creating new pores in the cell membrane and disrupting ion fluxes KP4 is a virally encoded and highly specific toxin that kills fungi closely related to the fungus Ustilago maydis.  The P4 strain of the corn smut fungus, Ustilago maydis, secretes a fungal toxin, KP4, encoded by a fungal virus (UMV4) that persistently infects its cells.  These results led to experiments demonstrating that the toxin specifically inhibits voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in mammalian cells.  Ustilago maydis killer toxins are small polypeptides (7-14 kDa) which kill susceptible cells of closely related fungal species.

"[SOC]###context: We show here that RNA splicing speckled domains (splicing speckles) fluctuate in constrained nuclear volumes and remodel their shapes.  We present a model where recycling splicing factors return as part of small sub-speckles from distal sites of RNA processing to larger splicing speckles by a directed ATP-driven mechanism through interchromatin spaces.  Analysis of a HeLa cell line stably expressing EYFP-NHPX showed that the nucleolar accumulation of NHPX was preceded by its transient accumulation in splicing speckles.  In vivo analysis of NHPX reveals a novel nucleolar localization pathway involving a transient accumulation in splicing speckles.  ""Splicing speckles"" are major nuclear domains rich in components of the splicing machinery and polyA(+) RNA.  Although speckles contain little detectable transcriptional activity, they are found preferentially associated with specific mRNA-coding genes and gene-rich R bands, and they accumulate some unspliced pre-mRNAs RNA polymerase II transcribes mRNAs and is required for splicing, with some reports suggesting that the inactive complexes are stored in splicing speckle In normal cell growth conditions GFPeIF4A-III was mainly nucleoplasmic, but in hypoxia stress conditions it moved to the nucleolus and splicing speckles.  Localization of eIF4A-III in the nucleolus and splicing speckles is an indicator of plant stress.

"[SOC]###context: FHOD1, a poorly studied formin, appeared to be markedly upregulated upon EMT.  Furthermore, functional assays demonstrated that FHOD1 contributes to cell migration and invasion.  Finally, FHOD1 depletion reduced the ability of EMT cancer cells to form invadopodia and to degrade extracellular matrix.  Our results indicate that FHOD1 participates in cytoskeletal changes in EMT.  Invadopodia are considered to be crucial structures that allow cancer cells to penetrate across the extracellular matrix (ECM) by using matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).  Previously, we isolated a highly invasive A431-III subline from parental A431 cells by Boyden chamber assay.  The A431-III cells possess higher invasive and migratory abilities, elevated levels of MMP-9 and an enhanced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype.  In this study, we discovered that A431-III cells had an increased potential to form invadopodia and an improved capacity to degrade ECM compared with the original A431 cells.  Activated Twist upregulates N-cadherin and downregulates E-cadherin, which are the hallmarks of EMT.  Moreover, Twist plays an important role in some physiological processes involved in metastasis, like angiogenesis, invadopodia, extravasation, and chromosomal instability.  Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-stimulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important developmental process that has also been implicated in increased cell invasion and metastatic potential of cancer cells.  Herein, we demonstrate that TGF-β-induced Hic-5 up-regulation or ectopic expression of Hic-5 in normal MCF10A cells promoted increased extracellular matrix degradation and invasion through the formation of invadopodia.  These data identify Hic-5 as a critical mediator of TGF-β-stimulated invadopodia formation, cell migration, and invasion.  Recently, invadopodia have been increasingly recognized as important drivers of local invasion in metastasis.  Invadopodia are basally-localized, actin-rich structures that concentrate protease activity to areas of the cell in contact with the extracellular matrix.  We recently found that the transcription factor Twist1, a central regulator of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), promotes invadopodia formation via upregulation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) expression and activity.  Twist1-induced invadopodia formation promotes tumor metastasis The Twist1 transcription factor is known to promote tumor metastasis and induce Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT).  Here, we report that Twist1 is capable of promoting the formation of invadopodia, specialized membrane protrusions for extracellular matrix degradation.  Twist1 induces PDGFRα expression, which in turn activates Src, to promote invadopodia formation.  We show that Twist1 and PDGFRα are central mediators of invadopodia formation in response to various EMT-inducing signals.  Podosome-like structures of non-invasive carcinoma cells are replaced in epithelial-mesenchymal transition by actin comet-embedded invadopodia Podosomes and invadopodia are actin-based structures at the ventral cell membrane, which have a role in cell adhesion, migration and invasion.  In conclusion, EMT affects the invasion machinery of oral squamous carcinoma cells.  Non-invasive squamous carcinoma cells constitutively organize podosomes, whereas invasive cells form invadopodia.  The club-ended cell extensions, or externalized invadopodia, are involved in ECM degradation and maintenance of contact to adhesion substrate and surrounding cells during invasion.  In a process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), besides changing their adhesive repertoire, cancer cells employ developmental processes to gain migratory and invasive properties that involve a dramatic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and the concomitant formation of membrane protrusions required for invasive growth.  The molecular processes underlying such cellular changes are still only poorly understood, and the various migratory organelles, including lamellipodia, filopodia, invadopodia and podosomes, still require a better functional and molecular characterization.

Moreover, by using selective antagonists, the role of 5-HT1B/1D serotonergic receptors was investigated in the antinociception induced by these antimigraine drugs. The formalin test was used to assess the nociceptive activity.  In this study, we examined the effect of systemic morphine on Fos-like immunoreactivity (FLI) evoked in the formalin test, a widely used model of persistent pain.  The formalin test for nociception, predominantly used with rodents, is characterized by continuous pain due to tissue injury induced by formalin.  The orofacial formalin test can then be considered as a reliable way of producing and quantifying nociception in the trigeminal region of the rat. <br> The formalin test is used as a primary behavioural screen for assaying the antinociceptive activity of compounds in laboratory rodents.  The formalin test is the most accepted chemical test for evaluation of nociception.  Nociceptive responses were measured by formalin test (50µl injection of formalin 2% subcutaneously into hind paw) and pain related behaviors were monitored for 90 min.  Formalin injection induces nociceptive bahaviour in phase I and II, with a quiescent phase between them.   The rat paw formalin test is a model of prolonged pain due to mild tissue injury.   The formalin test is increasingly applied as a model of inflammatory pain using high formalin concentrations (5-15%).

"[SOC]###context: Whether the factor has the same role in humans is of clinical interest because an inhibitor for RANKL, denosumab, is already used for the treatment of bone disease and might benefit breast cancer patients.  Treatment of AML cells with the clinically available RANKL Ab Denosumab resulted in enhanced NK cell anti-leukemia reactivity.   The emerging clinical implication, supported by recent epidemiological studies, is that βAR-blockers and drugs interfering with RANKL signaling, such as Denosumab, could increase patient survival if used as adjuvant therapy to inhibit both the early colonization of bone by metastatic breast cancer cells and the initiation of the ""vicious cycle"" of bone destruction induced by these cells.  Both the effects of RANKL on osteoclastogenesis and cytokine production by malignant cells could be blocked by disruption of RANK-RANKL interaction with denosumab.  In the future, the armamentarium against osteoporotic fractures will likely be enriched by (1. ) new bone anabolic substances such as antibodies directed against the endogenous inhibitors of bone formation sclerostin and dickkopf-1, PTH and PTHrp analogues, and possibly calcilytics; (2. ) new inhibitors of bone resorption such as cathepsin K inhibitors which may suppress osteoclast function without impairing osteoclast viability and thus maintain bone formation by preserving the osteoclast-osteoblast crosstalk, and denosumab, an already widely available antibody against RANKL which inhibits osteoclast formation, function, and survival; and (3. ) new therapeutic strategies based on an extended understanding of the pathophysiology of osteoporosis which may include sequential therapies with two or more bone active substances aimed at optimising the management of bone capital acquired during adolescence and maintained during adulthood in terms of both quantity and quality.   Clearly, the approval of denosumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against RANKL, has just marked the beginning of a new era for bone therapy with several additional new therapies lining up for clinical approval in the coming years.  Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody to RANK Ligand that is administered as a 60-mg subcutaneous injection every 6 months.  More recently, a nuclear factor-β ligand (RANKL) inhibitor, denosumab, has been             developed for the treatment of bone metastases.  Denosumab is a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to RANKL and has recently been found to inhibit SRE more effectively than BP.   Recently, denosumab, a noncytotoxic IgG2 monoclonal antibody with high affinity for human RANKL, has been demonstrated to significantly prevent clinically relevant increase in pain compared with zoledronic acid across the tumor types.   Denosumab, an anti-RANKL monoclonal antibody with proven antiosteoclast activity, may suppress immune responses.   We also review unresolved controversies surrounding the management of these conditions by administration of nutritional vitamin D (ergocalciferol and cholecalciferol), vitamin D receptor activators (calcitriol, alphacalcidiol, doxercalciferol), D-mimetics (paricalcitol, maxacalcitol), calcimimetics (cinacalcet), recombinant PTH (teriparatide), and receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand modulators (denosumab); compare mortality predictability of PTH and alkaline phosphatase; and examine potential risks of bone disorders and mineral disarrays in CKD patients.  New therapies such as the antibody to RANKL (denosumab) are undergoing phase III clinical testing.   Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand is an important cytokine involved in osteoclast activation; denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody to this molecule, has finished a major fracture trial.   Initials studies have demonstrated that targeting RANK/ RANKL signaling with the fully human monoclonal antibody denosumab prevented skeletal complications in patients with MM and other cancers with bone metastases.   A highly specific, fully human antibody against RANKL has been produced (denosumab) that in early studies in humans reduces bone turnover and improves bone density.  Denosumab (AMG 162), a fully human monoclonal antibody to RANKL, shares the pharmacologic attributes of OPG but has a significantly longer half-life that allows less frequent administration.

"[SOC]###context: Phylogenetic reconstruction using molecular data is often subject to homoplasy, leading to inaccurate conclusions about phylogenetic relationships among operational taxonomic units.  Our use of nonhomoplastic whole-genome SNP characters allows branch points and clade membership to be estimated with great precision The control region proved to be a less useful molecular marker for the population genetics and the phylogenetic reconstruction of closely related taxa in A.  urticae than it has for other species.  The extreme bias in adenine and thymine content (A+T=90. 91%) probably renders this region highly susceptible to homoplasy, resulting in a less informative molecular marker.  Minimal homoplasy (consistency index = 0. 9591) was detected among parsimony-informative SNPs, allowing for the generation of a highly accurate phylogenetic reconstruction of the CC398 clonal lineage.  These findings provide evidence for the occurrence of a high degree of homoplasy in the DR locus leading to convergent evolution to identical spoligotypes.  The incongruence between Large Sequence Polymorphism and spoligotype polymorphism argues against the use of spoligotyping for establishing phylogenetic relationships within the Euro-American lineage.  The species diversity of the phylum Rotifera has been largely studied on the basis of morphological characters.  However, cladistic relationships within this group are poorly resolved due to extensive homoplasy in morphological traits Molecular evolutionary processes modify DNA over time, creating both newly derived substitutions shared by related descendant lineages (phylogenetic signal) and ""false"" similarities which confound phylogenetic reconstruction (homoplasy).  This added level of homoplasic ""noise"" can make DNA regions with repeats less reliable in phylogenetic reconstruction than those without repeats.  Computational and phylogenetic analyses suggest that only some BH3 motifs arose by divergent evolution from a common ancestor (homology), whereas others arose by convergent evolution or random coincidence (homoplasy) The high frequency of morphological homoplasy in pennatulaceans has led to many misinterpretations in the systematics of the group.  Conflict among data sources can be frequent in evolutionary biology, especially in cases where one character set poses limitations to resolution.  Earthworm taxonomy, for example, remains a challenge because of the limited number of morphological characters taxonomically valuable.  An explanation to this may be morphological convergence due to adaptation to a homogeneous habitat, resulting in high degrees of homoplasy.  This sometimes impedes clear morphological diagnosis of species.  We also report one of the first findings of homoplasy in mitochondrial gene order, namely a shared relative position of trnV in unrelated isopod lineages.  This taxon therefore provides the opportunity to evaluate those neural characters common to these two clades likely to be results of shared ancestry (homology) versus convergence (homoplasy).   Taxa that experienced molecular homoplasy, recent selection, a spur of evolution, and so forth may disrupt the inference and cause incongruences in the estimated phylogeny.  myrmecophagy in these mammalian lineages was more likely because of homoplasy (convergent evolution) than being an ancestral character.  The four regions were equally affected by homoplasy and were, therefore, equally unreliable for phylogenetic reconstruction.  Early hominid masticatory characters are widely considered to be more prone to homoplasy than characters from other regions of the early hominid skull and therefore less reliable for phylogenetic reconstruction.  These findings are in clear contrast with the views that rapidly evolving regions and the 3rd codon position have inevitable negative impact on phylogenetic reconstruction at deep historic level due to accumulation of multiple hits and subsequent elevation in homoplasy and saturation.  Phylogenetic reconstructions are often plagued by difficulties in distinguishing phylogenetic signal (due to shared ancestry) from phylogenetic noise or homoplasy (due to character-state convergences or reversals).  Homoplasy, in particular, is a difficulty faced by all methods of phylogenetic inference.  Homoplasy, in particular, is a difficulty faced by all methods of phylogenetic inference.  Sequence-based methods for phylogenetic reconstruction from (nucleic acid) sequence data are notoriously plagued by two effects: homoplasies and alignment errors Early hominid masticatory characters are widely considered to be more prone to homoplasy than characters from other regions of the early hominid skull and therefore less reliable for phylogenetic reconstruction Molecular evolutionary processes modify DNA over time, creating both newly derived substitutions shared by related descendant lineages (phylogenetic signal) and ""false"" similarities which confound phylogenetic reconstruction (homoplasy) The four regions were equally affected by homoplasy and were, therefore, equally unreliable for phylogenetic reconstruction mellifera that the detection of size homoplasy may alter phylogenetic reconstructions. 
###question: How homoplasy affects phylogenetic reconstruction?[EOC] [SOR]###response: Evolutionary processes create both newly derived characteristics shared by related descendant lineages (homology) and ""false"" similarities which confound phylogenetic reconstruction (homoplasy).  Homology arises by divergent evolution from a common ancestor and provides us with a phylogenetic signal, while homoplasy arises by convergent evolution or random coincidence.  Homoplastic characters do not allows branch points and clade membership to be accurately estimated, as they may group unrelated taxa together.  Such characters add ""noise"" in phylogenetic analysis and are not informative for the population genetics and the phylogenetic reconstruction of closely related taxa.  In phylogenetic reconstruction, homoplasy leads to inaccurate conclusions about phylogenetic relationships among operational taxonomic units, and characters with high degree of homoplasy result in incongruences of cladistic relationships.

"[SOC]###context: METHODS: Outcomes of surgery, prognostic factors for survival, and relevance of Tomita and Tokuhashi scores were investigated.  PURPOSE: To assess variability in the use of Tomita and modified Bauer scores in spine metastases.  Only the Tomita scoring system was shown to be an independent prognostic factor for overall survival.   . CONCLUSION: The Tomita scoring system represents a practicable and highly predictive prognostic tool.   Analysis of the predictive role and new proposal for surgical strategies based on the modified Tomita and Tokuhashi scoring systems for spinal metastasis.  We also aimed to evaluate the validity of the prognostic scores in the Tomita and Tokuhashi systems and discuss several aspects to improve the predictive accuracy of these systems.   CONCLUSIONS: Tomita scores more accurately predicted survival than Tokuhashi scores.   A comparison of the modified Tokuhashi and Tomita scores in determining prognosis for patients afflicted with spinal metastasis.   It is for this reason that scoring systems, such as the modified Tokuhashi and Tomita scores, have been created The modified Tokuhashi score had better accuracy in determining actual survival.  Tokuhashi, Tomita, Bauer, and Oswestry scores have been devised for survival prediction; however, none of these systems have been evaluated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).  All four scoring systems could be used to prognosticate these patients.  The modified Tokuhashi score is the best in doing so.  Primary tumor type and Tokuhashi score independently predicted survival in patients with spinal metastases.   Primary tumor type and Tokuhashi scoring independently predicted survival in patients with spinal metastases after surgery.  A predictive score was then developed and compared against that of the modified Bauer score alone in terms of prognosticating 1-year survival after surgery.  Our predictive score performed better than the modified Bauer alone and may be used to predict survival after surgical intervention for metastatic disease.  Tokuhashi Scoring System has limited applicability in the majority of patients with spinal cord compression secondary to vertebral metastasis.  Tokuhashi Scoring System has limited applicability in the majority of patients with spinal cord compression secondary to vertebral metastasis Tokuhashi, Tomita, Bauer, and Oswestry scores have been devised for survival prediction; however, none of these systems have been evaluated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). To investigate the accuracy of these scoring systems in predicting survival and to identify prognostic factors for survival of the patients with spinal metastases from NPC. Retrospective analysis of the patients with spinal metastases from NPC who were treated in our institution. The study included 87 patients with spinal metastases from NPC. The primary outcome measure was the survival time of these patients Predictive value of survival by modified Tokuhashi score was the highest among all four scoring systems. Patients with spinal metastases from NPC have relatively good survival prognosis The data of the present study emphasize that the original Bauer score and a modified Bauer score without scoring for pathologic fracture seem to be practicable and highly predictive preoperative scoring systems for patients with spinal metastases A retrospective study of 180 patients with lung cancer spinal metastases, wherein prognostic score-predicted survival was compared with actual survival.

"[SOC]###context: Evidence that the methylation state of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene predicts brain activity of MAO A enzyme in healthy men.  We found significant interindividual differences in methylation status and methylation patterns of the core MAOA promoter.   In the present study, DNA methylation patterns in the MAOA regulatory and exon 1/intron 1 region were investigated for association with panic disorder with particular attention to possible effects of gender and environmental factors.    The present pilot data suggest a potential role of MAOA gene hypomethylation in the pathogenesis of panic disorder particularly in female patients, possibly mediating a detrimental influence of negative life events.   The MAOA promoter was hypermethylated immediately upstream of the start codon in cholangiocarcinoma samples and cell lines but not in nonmalignant counterparts.   MAOA promoter methylation and susceptibility to carotid atherosclerosis: role of familial factors in a monozygotic twin sample.  Because twins reared together share early life experience, which may leave a long-lasting epigenetic mark, aberrant MAOA methylation may represent an early biomarker for unhealthy familial environment.  Effects of MAOA promoter methylation on susceptibility to paranoid schizophrenia.  In conclusion, abnormalities of DNA methylation at the MAOA promoter may be associated with schizophrenia in males.  In our study we analyzed DNA methylation patterns of 14 neuropsychiatric genes (COMT, DAT1, GABRA1, GNB3, GRIN2B, HTR1B, HTR2A, 5-HTT, MAOA, MAOB, NOS1, NR3C1, TPH1 and TH).  D Our data suggest that aberrant epigenetic regulation of neuropsychiatric genes may contribute to the pathogenesis of BPD.  We conclude that smoking reliably decreases MAOA methylation, but exact characterization of effects on level of methylation depend on genotype, smoking history, current smoking status, gender, and region of the promoter-associated CpG Island examined.  Given that DNA methylation is linked to the regulation of gene expression, we hypothesized that epigenetic mechanisms factor into the MAOA expression  the extended MAOA regulatory region contains two CpG islands (CGIs), one of which overlaps with the canonical MAOA promoter and the other is located further upstream; both CGIs exhibit sensitivity to differential methylation.  Identification and characterization of putative methylation targets in the MAOA locus using bioinformatic approaches.  DNA methylation is a key epigenetic mechanism involved in the developmental regulation of gene expression.   MAOA methylation is associated with nicotine and alcohol dependence in women.  In recent years, the role of epigenetic phenomenon, such as methylation, in mediating vulnerability to behavioral illness has become increasingly appreciated.  One prominent locus at which epigenetic phenomena are thought to be in play is the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) locus.   We conclude that methylation of MAOA may play a significant role in common psychiatric illness and that further examination of epigenetic processes at this locus is in order.  Analysis of CpG methylation in the MAOA promoter region revealed substantial methylation in females but not in males.  Therefore, allelic mRNA expression is affected by genetic and epigenetic events, both with the potential to modulate biogenic amine tone in the CNS.

Isolates were genotyped by analysis of their 4CMenB vaccine antigen genes of PorA, factor H binding protein (fHbp), Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA), and Neisseria Adhesin A (NadA).  Vaccine components were typed by sequencing for factor H-binding protein (fHbp), Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA) and Neisseria adhesin A (NadA).   Neisseria adhesin A (NadA), involved in the adhesion and invasion of Neisseria meningitidis into host tissues, is one of the major components of Bexsero, a novel multicomponent vaccine licensed for protection against meningococcal serogroup B in Europe, Australia, and Canada.  NadA has been identified in approximately 30% of clinical isolates and in a much lower proportion of carrier isolates.  Three protein variants were originally identified in invasive meningococci and named NadA-1, NadA-2, and NadA-3, whereas most carrier isolates either lacked the gene or harbored a different variant, NadA-4.  Further analysis of isolates belonging to the sequence type 213 (ST-213) clonal complex identified NadA-5, which was structurally similar to NadA-4, but more distantly related to NadA-1, -2, and -3.  At the time of this writing, more than 89 distinct nadA allele sequences and 43 distinct peptides have been described.   The main features of this new scheme include (i) the grouping of the previously named NadA-2 and NadA-3 variants into a single NadA-2/3 variant, (ii) the grouping of the previously assigned NadA-4 and NadA-5 variants into a single NadA-4/5 variant, (iii) the introduction of an additional variant (NadA-6), and (iv) the classification of the variants into two main groups, named groups I and II.   To broaden the scope of its protection, the multicomponent vaccine (4CMenB) incorporates a PorA-containing outer membrane vesicle (OMV) alongside relatively conserved recombinant protein components, including factor H-binding protein (fHbp), Neisseria adhesin A (NadA), and neisserial heparin-binding antigen (NHBA).   Nine N.  meningitidis isolates (eight MenB and one MenY) were found to possess at least one gene that encoded for an antigen that matched exactly with protein variants in the 4CMenB vaccine.  Two MenB expressed PorA antigen P1. 4 and possessed the nhba gene for peptide 2; four other MenB were predicted to have NHBA peptide 2; another two MenB were predicted to encode fHbp peptide 1. 1; and a single MenY was found to have nadA gene for NadA peptide 8.  Isolates were genotyped by analysis of their 4CMenB vaccine antigen genes of PorA, factor H binding protein (fHbp), Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA), and Neisseria Adhesin A (NadA).

Role of ARF6, Rab11 and external Hsp90 in the trafficking and recycling of recombinant-soluble Neisseria meningitidis adhesin A (rNadA) in human epithelial cells.  A new vaccine (the 4CMenB 4-component protein vaccine [Bexsero], which includes PorA, factor H-binding protein [fHbp], neisserial heparin-binding antigen [NHBA], and Neisseria adhesin A [NadA]) against serogroup B meningococci has recently been approved for use in people older than age 2 months in Europe, Australia, and Canada.  Neisseria adhesin A (NadA), involved in the adhesion and invasion of Neisseria meningitidis into host tissues, is one of the major components of Bexsero, a novel multicomponent vaccine licensed for protection against meningococcal serogroup B in Europe, Australia, and Canada.  With the aim of studying the molecular diversity of the antigens of a new recombinant vaccine against meningococcus serogroup B, the three genes coding for the main vaccine components GNA (Genome-derived Neisseria Antigen) 1870 (fHbp, factor H Binding Protein), GNA1994 (NadA, Neisseria adhesin A) and GNA2132 were sequenced in a panel of 85 strains collected worldwide and selected as representative of the serogroup B meningococcal diversity.

Vaccine components were typed by sequencing for factor H-binding protein (fHbp), Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA) and Neisseria adhesin A (NadA).  Isolates were genotyped by analysis of their 4CMenB vaccine antigen genes of PorA, factor H binding protein (fHbp), Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA), and Neisseria Adhesin A (NadA). Of the 263 IMD isolates analysed, 229, 16, 10, 7, and 1 belonged to MenB, MenY, MenW, MenC, and MenX, respectively.  Neisseria adhesin A (NadA) is one of the antigens of Bexsero, the recently licensed multicomponent vaccine against serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis (MenB).  Neisseria adhesin A (NadA) is present on the meningococcal surface and contributes to adhesion to and invasion of human cells.  Isolates were genotyped by analysis of their 4CMenB vaccine antigen genes of PorA, factor H binding protein (fHbp), Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA), and Neisseria Adhesin A (NadA).  We analyzed the sequence variability of factor H-binding protein (fHbp), Neisserial Heparin-Binding Antigen (NHBA) and Neisseria adhesin A (NadA), three major antigens in the multicomponent meningococcal serogroup B vaccine 4CMenB.

"[SOC]###context: We hypothesized that metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancers with DNA-repair defects would respond to poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition with olaparib. METHODS: We conducted a phase 2 trial in which patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer were treated with olaparib tablets at a dose of 400 mg twice a day.   CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with the PARP inhibitor olaparib in patients whose prostate cancers were no longer responding to standard treatments and who had defects in DNA-repair genes led to a high response rate.    In addition, phase III trials in breast, gastric and pancreatic cancer are underway/planned, and phase I/II investigation is being conducted in other malignancies, including prostate cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, Ewing's sarcoma and advanced cancer.   In a phase II study, researchers found that the PARP inhibitor olaparib led to stable disease or tumor regressions in patients with advanced breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancers who had germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2.  Eligibility included ovarian cancer resistant to prior platinum; breast cancer with ≥ three chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease; pancreatic cancer with prior gemcitabine treatment; or prostate cancer with progression on hormonal and one systemic therapy.   The tumor response rate was 26. 2% (78 of 298; 95% CI, 21. 3 to 31. 6) overall and 31. 1% (60 of 193; 95% CI, 24. 6 to 38. 1), 12. 9% (eight of 62; 95% CI, 5. 7 to 23. 9), 21. 7% (five of 23; 95% CI, 7. 5 to 43. 7), and 50. 0% (four of eight; 95% CI, 15. 7 to 84. 3) in ovarian, breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancers, respectively.  Stable disease ≥ 8 weeks was observed in 42% of patients (95% CI, 36. 0 to 47. 4), including 40% (95% CI, 33. 4 to 47. 7), 47% (95% CI, 34. 0 to 59. 9), 35% (95% CI, 16. 4 to 57. 3), and 25% (95% CI, 3. 2 to 65. 1) of those with ovarian, breast, pancreatic, or prostate cancer, respectively.   It is increasingly clear that there are molecularly distinct subtypes of various common cancers, with different therapeutic approaches required for each subtype, for example, the use of the monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab and cetuximab) in HER2-positive breast cancer and wild-type KRAS colorectal cancer; tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib, gefitinib, erlotinib and crizotinib) in chronic myeloid leukaemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumours and non-small-cell lung cancer and intracellular agents (vemurafenib and olaparib) in metastatic malignant melanoma and ovarian, breast and prostate cancer.  Olaparib, one of the most studied PARPis, has demonstrated activity in BRCA1/2(MUT+) and BRCA-like sporadic ovarian and breast cancers, and looks promising in prostate and pancreatic cancers.  Prostate cancer cells cotreated with the HDAC inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and the PARPi, olaparib, demonstrated a synergistic decrease in cell viability compared with single-agent treatment (combination index<0. 9), whereas normal prostatic cells did not.  CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with the PARP inhibitor olaparib in patients whose prostate cancers were no longer responding to standard treatments and who had defects in DNA-repair genes led to a high response rate.  Olaparib, one of the most studied PARPis, has demonstrated activity in BRCA1/2(MUT+) and BRCA-like sporadic ovarian and breast cancers, and looks promising in prostate and pancreatic cancers.   DNA-Repair Defects and Olaparib in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.  Prostate cancer cells cotreated with the HDAC inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and the PARPi, olaparib, demonstrated a synergistic decrease in cell viability compared with single-agent treatment (combination index < 0. 9), whereas normal prostatic cells did not.  We hypothesized that metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancers with DNA-repair defects would respond to poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition with olaparib.  A phase II study of the PARP inhibitor olaparib (AstraZeneca) for cancer patients with inherited BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations confirmed earlier results showing clinical benefit for advanced breast and ovarian cancers, and demonstrated evidence of effectiveness against pancreatic and prostate cancers.  BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease, but current treatments are not based on molecular stratification.  We hypothesized that metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancers with DNA-repair defects would respond to poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition with olaparib. METHODS: We conducted a phase 2 trial in which patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer were treated with olaparib tablets at a dose of 400 mg twice a day.   Prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease, but current treatments are not based on molecular stratification.  We hypothesized that metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancers with DNA-repair defects would respond to poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition with olaparib.  Silencing RAD51 sensitized prostate cancer cells to SAHA and olaparib alone.  Collectively, cotreatment with HDACi and PARPi downregulated HR-related protein expression and concomitantly increased DNA damage, resulting in prostate cancer cell death.  Prostate cancer cells cotreated with the HDAC inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and the PARPi, olaparib, demonstrated a synergistic decrease in cell viability compared with single-agent treatment (combination index<0. 9), whereas normal prostatic cells did not.   The specificity of the biomarker suite was 94%.  Anemia (in 10 of the 50 patients [20%]) and fatigue (in 6 [12%]) were the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events, findings that are consistent with previous studies of olaparib. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with the PARP inhibitor olaparib in patients whose prostate cancers were no longer responding to standard treatments and who had defects in DNA-repair genes led to a high response rate.   Prostate cancer cells cotreated with the HDAC inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and the PARPi, olaparib, demonstrated a synergistic decrease in cell viability compared with single-agent treatment (combination index &lt; 0. 9), whereas normal prostatic cells did not.  In addition, phase III trials in breast, gastric and pancreatic cancer are underway/planned, and phase I/II investigation is being conducted in other malignancies, including prostate cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, Ewing's sarcoma and advanced cancer.   INTERPRETATION: Olaparib has antitumour activity against metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with DDR gene aberrations, supporting the implementation of genomic stratification of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in clinical practice.  CONCLUSIONS: In men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had disease progression while receiving enzalutamide or abiraterone and who had alterations in genes with a role in homologous recombination repair, olaparib was associated with longer progression-free survival and better measures of response and patient-reported end points than either enzalutamide or abiraterone.  Olaparib is an additional option for second- and third-line treatment in those with alterations in BRCA1, BRCA2, and ATM.   In this review, we describe current therapies for mCRPC, the rationale for anti-PARP therapies, the pharmacology of olaparib for prostate cancer, clinical trials of olaparib for mCRPC, our clinical experience with olaparib for prostate cancer at a comprehensive cancer center, and future directions of olaparib for the treatment of mCRPC.

The TOPARP-A clinical trial demonstrated that the PARP inhibitor olaparib may be an effective strategy for treating prostate cancer.  MMARY: The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors olaparib and rucaparib are now approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.  Here, we  BACKGROUND: We previously reported that olaparib led to significantly longer imaging-based progression-free survival than the physician's choice of enzalutamide or abiraterone among men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had qualifying alterations in homologous recombination repair genes and whose disease had progressed during previous treatment with a next-generation hormonal agent.  Recent clinical studies show favorable results for the PARP inhibitor olaparib used as single agent for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant PCa.  The PROFOUND phase III trial, comparing olaparib with enzalutamide/abiraterone therapy, revealed increased radiological progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS) among patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with BRCA1, BRCA2 or ATM mutations.  Olaparib Targets Some Advanced Prostate Cancers.  The PARP inhibitor (PARPi) olaparib received FDA breakthrough designation for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancers (CRPC) carrying mutations in BRCA1/2 or ATM genes.   In prostate cancer, two PARPi, rucaparib and olaparib, have been FDA approved for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Olaparib is an FDA-approved PARP inhibitor (PARPi) that has shown promise as a synthetic lethal treatment approach for BRCA-mutant castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in clinical use Targeting Plk1 to Enhance Efficacy of Olaparib in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer RECENT FINDINGS: The approval of several PARPi (olaparib, rucaparib, and niraparib) has driven the focus of anticancer treatment on synthetic lethality in prostate cancer too.   PATIENT SUMMARY: A large clinical study concluded that treatment with the PARP inhibitor olaparib benefits men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer whose tumors harbor alterations in 15 different DNA repair genes.   Among them, olaparib and rucaparib have breakthrough designations for BRCA1/2-mutated mCRPC.  In phase II clinical trials, including patients with advanced castration-resistant PC, olaparib seems to be efficacious and well tolerated.   Of note is the recent U. S.  Food and Drug Administration breakthrough therapy designation of olaparib for the treatment of BRCA1/2- or ATM-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

TMB finding pipeline: novel approach for detecting beta-barrel membrane proteins in genomic sequences.  Interestingly, the present approach identified TMBs from all 15 families in TCDB.  A new method is presented for identification of beta-barrel membrane proteins.  It is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) with an architecture obeying these proteins' construction principles.  Once the HMM is trained, log-odds score relative to a null model is used to discriminate beta-barrel membrane proteins from other proteins.  PRED-TMBB: a web server for predicting the topology of beta-barrel outer membrane proteins.  We present here a web server (PRED-TMBB, http://bioinformatics. biol. uoa. gr/PRED-TMBB) which is capable of predicting the transmembrane strands and the topology of beta-barrel outer membrane proteins of Gram-negative bacteria.  The method is based on a Hidden Markov Model, trained according to the Conditional Maximum Likelihood criterion.  Predicting transmembrane beta-barrels in proteomes.  Here we introduced the design, statistics and results of a novel profile-based hidden Markov model for the prediction and discrimination of TMBs.  A sequence-profile-based HMM for predicting and discriminating beta barrel membrane proteins.  RESULTS: We develop a HMM model, which can predict the topology of beta barrel membrane proteins using, as input, evolutionary information.  BOMP: a program to predict integral beta-barrel outer membrane proteins encoded within genomes of Gram-negative bacteria.  This work describes the development of a program that predicts whether or not a polypeptide sequence from a Gram-negative bacterium is an integral beta-barrel outer membrane protein.  The program, called the beta-barrel Outer Membrane protein Predictor (BOMP), is based on two separate components to recognize integral beta-barrel proteins.  On the basis of existing knowledge of beta-barrel outer-membrane proteins, several state of the art prediction methods, as well as a new in-house program (PROB) were employed for the systematic exploration of Mycobacterium tuberculosis predicted proteomes for potential beta-barrel structures.  Computational identification of beta-barrel outer-membrane proteins in Mycobacterium tuberculosis predicted proteomes as putative vaccine candidates.  BETAWARE: a machine-learning tool to detect and predict transmembrane beta-barrel proteins in prokaryotes.  Recently, we developed two top-performing methods based on machine-learning approaches to tackle both the detection of TMBBs in sets of proteins and the prediction of their topology.  Supersecondary structure prediction of transmembrane beta-barrel proteins.  We introduce a graph-theoretic model for predicting the supersecondary structure of transmembrane β-barrel proteins--a particular class of proteins that performs diverse important functions but it is difficult to determine their structure with experimental methods.  BOCTOPUS: improved topology prediction of transmembrane β barrel proteins.  Here, we present BOCTOPUS; an improved method for the topology prediction of TMBs by employing a combination of support vector machines (SVMs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs).  TMBHMM: a frequency profile based HMM for predicting the topology of transmembrane beta barrel proteins and the exposure status of transmembrane residues.  We present here TMBHMM, a computational method based on a hidden Markov model for predicting the structural topology of putative TMBs from sequence.  In addition to predicting transmembrane strands, TMBHMM also predicts the exposure status (i. e. , exposed to the membrane or hidden in the protein structure) of the residues in the transmembrane region, which is a novel feature of the TMBHMM method.  Furthermore, TMBHMM can also predict the membrane residues that are not part of beta barrel forming strands.  We present BTMX (Beta barrel TransMembrane eXposure), a computational method to predict the exposure status (i. e.  exposed to the bilayer or hidden in the protein structure) of transmembrane residues in transmembrane beta barrel proteins (TMBs).  BTMX predicts the exposure status of known TM residues with an accuracy of 84. 2% over 2,225 residues and provides a confidence score for all predictions.

A web server based on the proposed method is available at http://yanbioinformatics. cs. usu. edu:8080/TMBKNNsubmit.  This paper presents a k-nearest neighbor (K-NN) method for discriminating TMB and non-TMB proteins.  TMBpro: secondary structure, beta-contact and tertiary structure prediction of transmembrane beta-barrel proteins.  We develop a suite (TMBpro) of specialized predictors for predicting secondary structure (TMBpro-SS), beta-contacts (TMBpro-CON) and tertiary structure (TMBpro-3D) of transmembrane beta-barrel proteins.  We compare our results to the recent state-of-the-art predictors transFold and PRED-TMBB using their respective benchmark datasets, and leave-one-out cross-validation.  A consensus algorithm to screen genomes for novel families of transmembrane beta barrel proteins.

"[SOC]###context: Our data shows that transcription proceeds in some ways as if operons were composed of multiple adjacent single genes.   Previous work has proposed that germline expression drives operon organization in Caenorhabditis elegans, and a recent hypothesis proposes that operons provide an evolutionary advantage via the conservation of transcriptional machinery during recovery from growth arrested states.  Our data suggest that operons and ""spliced leader"" (SL) trans-splicing predate the radiation of the nematode phylum, an inference which is supported by the phylogenetic profile of proteins known to be involved in nematode SL trans-splicing.  These results provide support for the model that a necessity for increased transcriptional efficiency in the context of certain developmental processes could be a selective constraint for operon evolution in metazoans However, analysis of gene-expression profiles identified conserved functions such as an enrichment of germline-expressed genes and higher expression levels of operonic genes during recovery from dauer arrest in both species The operons contain primarily genes required for rapid growth, including genes whose products are needed for mitochondrial function and the basic machinery of gene expression.  Recent evidence suggests that RNA polymerase is poised at the promoters of growth genes, and operons allow more efficient recovery from growth-arrested states, resulting in reduction in the need for this cache of inactive RNA polymerase.  Caenorhabditis elegans operons contain a higher proportion of genes with multiple transcripts and use 3' splice sites differentially C.  elegans operons contain a much higher proportion of genes with multiple transcript isoforms than non-operonic genes do.   Our analyses suggest that C.  elegans operons enhance expression complexity by increasing the proportion of genes that express multiple transcript isoforms and maintain splicing efficiency by differential use of common 3' splice sites.  Based on a mathematic model of operon gains and losses and additional assumptions, we projected that the number of operons in C.  elegans will continue to rise by 6%-18% in future evolution before reaching equilibrium between operon gains and losses.  Our work suggests that hybrid operons are common in the C.  elegans genome and that internal promoters influence not only gene organization and expression but also operon evolution.  Because operons account for about 15% of the genes in C.  elegans, this lower duplication frequency might place a large constraint on the plasticity of the genome.  Further analyses suggest that this paucity of duplicated genes results from operon organization hindering specific types of gene duplication.  The operons contain primarily genes whose products are needed for mitochondrial function and the basic machinery of gene expression: transcription, splicing and translation.  Many operons contain genes whose products are known to function together.  This presumably provides co-regulation of these proteins by producing a single RNA that encodes both.  genes with experimentally determined expression rates in the exponential growth phase, those of highest molar abundances are more deviant from the average gene codon frequencies and are more similar in codon frequencies to the average ribosomal protein gene.

Resveratrol inhibits the mTOR mitogenic signaling evoked by oxidized LDL in smooth muscle cells esveratrol blocked the oxLDL-induced phosphorylation and activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway and strongly inhibited both the DNA synthesis and proliferation of SMC At concentrations that inhibit mTOR, resveratrol suppresses cellular senescence Here we demonstrated that, at cytostatic, near-toxic concentrations, resveratrol inhibited S6 phosphorylation and prevented the senescence morphology in human cells Resveratrol downregulates PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways in human U251 glioma cells On the other hand, RSV significantly increased the association between mTOR and its inhibitor, DEPTOR Resveratrol inhibits mTOR signaling by targeting DEPTOR Recent studies suggest that suppressing the signaling pathway mediated by mTOR, a well-known energy sensor that integrates various hormonal, nutrient and environmental signals to regulate cell growth, metabolism and survival, could play an important role in mediating the beneficial effect of RSV Resveratrol engages AMPK to attenuate ERK and mTOR signaling in sensory neurons and inhibits incision-induced acute and chronic pain Our results demonstrate that resveratrol profoundly inhibits ERK and mTOR signaling in sensory neurons in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion and that these effects are mediated by AMPK activation and independent of sirtuin activity Resveratrol enhances the antitumor effects of temozolomide in glioblastoma via ROS-dependent AMPK-TSC-mTOR signaling pathway Resveratrol enhances the anti-tumor activity of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin in multiple breast cancer cell lines mainly by suppressing rapamycin-induced AKT signaling.  Resveratrol inhibits mTOR signaling by promoting the interaction between mTOR and DEPTOR.  Consistent with the in vitro findings, resveratrol intervention in the PTEN knockout mouse model was associated with reduction in the prostatic levels of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity and increased expression of SIRT1.  Resveratrol inhibited the phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT and mTOR.  Resveratrol inhibits the mTOR mitogenic signaling evoked by oxidized LDL in smooth muscle cells.  Resveratrol also alleviated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling by down-regulation of Akt phosphorylation and up-regulation of PTEN expression.  Resveratrol blocked the oxLDL-induced phosphorylation and activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway and strongly inhibited both the DNA synthesis and proliferation of SMC.  Resveratrol reduced phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin further enhanced resveratrol-induced cell death.  Resveratrol downregulates PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways in human U251 glioma cells.  Our results demonstrate that resveratrol profoundly inhibits ERK and mTOR signaling in sensory neurons in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion and that these effects are mediated by AMPK activation and independent of sirtuin activity.  The SIRT1 activator resveratrol reduces, whereas SIRT1 inhibitor nicotinamide enhances mTOR activity in a SIRT1 dependent manner.  We conclude that resveratrol is an inhibitor of global protein synthesis, and that this effect is mediated through modulation of mTOR-dependent and independent signaling.  RSV treatment has no effect on the expression levels of mTOR, raptor and DEPTOR, but greatly promotes the interaction between mTOR and its inhibitor DEPTOR.  Taken together, our studies reveal that RSV inhibits leucine-stimulated mTORC1 activation by promoting mTOR/DEPTOR interaction and thus uncover a novel mechanism by which RSV negatively regulates mTOR activity.  Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of RSV on leucine-stimulated mTOR signaling was greatly reduced in cells in which the expression levels of DEPTOR were suppressed by RNAi Consistent with the in vitro findings, resveratrol intervention in the PTEN knockout mouse model was associated with reduction in the prostatic levels of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity and increased expression of SIRT1 The SIRT1 activator resveratrol reduces, whereas SIRT1 inhibitor nicotinamide enhances mTOR activity in a SIRT1 dependent manner However, most frequently, RSV is found to inhibit the activity of the mTOR pathway proteins, and to activate AMPK and LKB1, which can suppress mTOR signalling Over the past few years, numerous studies have suggested that suppressing the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a critical regulator of cell metabolism, growth, and proliferation, may provide a key mechanism underlying the anticarcinogenic properties of resveratrol Resveratrol blocks specifically this pathway, thereby inhibiting oxLDL-induced SMC proliferation.

It has been found that resveratrol targets multiple components of the phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase(PI3K)/Akt and mTOR signaling pathways, including PI3K, Akt, PTEN, and DEPTOR, suggesting that this natural compound and its derivatives may offer a promising new cancer treatment.   Autophagic cell death induced by resveratrol depends on the Ca(2+)/AMPK/mTOR pathway in A549 cells In conclusion, we demonstrate that resveratrol-induced A549 cell death was mediated by the process of autophagic cell death via Ca(2+)/AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway.

"[SOC]###context: The human phospholamban Arg14-deletion mutant localizes to plasma membrane and interacts with the Na/K-ATPase.  Moreover, PLN-R14Del did not co-immunoprecipitate with SERCA2a (as did WT-PLN), n this review, we attempted to highlight the functional significance of PLN in vertebrate cardiac physiology.  We will refer to the huge literature on mammals in order to describe the molecular characteristics of this protein, its interaction with SERCA2a There is clear evidence for direct regulatory protein-protein interactions between phospholamban (PLN) and the Ca2+-ATPase of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA2a) in cytoplasmic domains These results suggest that PLN modulates the apparent Ca2+ affinity of SERCA2a through intramembrane interactions, which are disrupted at long range and in concert with disruption of the well characterized cytoplasmic interactions.  Phospholamban (PLN), a homopentameric, integral membrane protein, reversibly inhibits cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a) activity through intramembrane interactions.  The concentration of this inhibited complex is determined by the dissociation constant for the PLN pentamer (which is mutation-sensitive) and by the dissociation constant for the PLN/SERCA2a heterodimer (which is likely to be mutation-sensitive).  These results support the proposal that PLN inhibition of SERCA2a involves, first, depolymerization of PLN and, second, the formation of inhibitory interactions between monomeric PLN and SERCA2a.  SLN and PLN appear to bind to the same regulatory site in SERCA.  However, in a ternary complex, PLN occupies the regulatory site and SLN binds to the exposed side of PLN and to SERCA.  Cellular and biochemical studies revealed that, unlike wild-type PLN, PLN(R9C) did not directly inhibit SERCA2a.  .  Conversely, using anti-SERCA2a antibody, both PLN and acylphosphatase were co-immunoprecipitated with SERCA2a, and the PLN amount in the precipitate decreased with increasing acylphosphatase concentrations.  Reconstitution of the cytoplasmic interaction between phospholamban and Ca(2+)-ATPase of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum.  Phospholamban (PLN) reversibly inhibits the Ca(2+)-ATPase of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA2a) through a direct protein-protein interaction, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) in heart muscle cells.  Phospholamban (PLN) is a key regulator of Ca(2+) homeostasis and contractility in the heart.  Its regulatory effects are mediated through its interaction with the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase, (SERCA2a), resulting in alterations of its Ca(2+)-affinity In a co-immunoprecipitation of PLN with SERCA2a, the physical interaction between the two proteins was increased in PUGNAc-treated cardiomyocytes.

"[SOC]###context: In this paper, we present findings from a project involving 20 patients with rare diseases, or parents thereof, participating in the 100,000 genomes project (100 kG P).  We explored their experiences of, and views about, the project, including why they took part, and their hopes and concerns about the future of genomic medicine.  Patients who attended genetic clinics for testing were offered the opportunity to undergo the more extensive whole genome sequencing (WGS) if they agreed to take part in the 100 kG P.  Once people had agreed, a specific additional appointment was organised for them.  Taking part in the project therefore involved additional travel and appointments ('clinical labour').  We found that interviewees' decisions to participate in 100 kG P were based on interpersonal and institutional trust in the NHS, and on an investment in improving care for the future.  Interviewees relied upon receiving good ongoing NHS care for managing their own or their child's rare disease, but they worried about what their relationships with NHS healthcare professionals would be like in future.  A few participants worried about whether Genomics England's biorepository would remain protected and an asset of the NHS.

"[SOC]###context: The world's first prospective controlled studies with the biologic human anti-IL4R antibody dupilumab for the indication ""atopic dermatitis"" were published in 2014.  These motivated (1) to extend the studies to dupilumab and (2) to clinically test antagonization of other target molecules of TH2 polarized, atopic inflammation, e. g. , IL-13, IL-31, IL-22, TSLP, and CRTH2.  A Among the recently developed antiasthma biologic drugs, the monoclonal antibody dupilumab is very promising because of its ability to inhibit the biological effects of both IL-4 and IL-13.  Indeed, dupilumab prevents IL-4/13 interactions with the α-subunit of the IL-4 receptor complex.   BACKGROUND: Dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks interleukin-4 and interleukin-13, has shown efficacy in patients with asthma and elevated eosinophil levels.    In early-phase trials, dupilumab, a fully human mAb targeting IL-4 receptor α, markedly improved disease activity, but the effect of IL-4/IL-13 blockade on AD at the molecular level has not been characterized.  Examples include the efficacy of omalizumab in patients with severe refractory atopic asthma characterized by raised serum total IgE, mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab in patients with recurrent eosinophilic exacerbations characterized by blood and sputum eosinophilia despite high doses of corticosteroids, and lebrikizumab, pitrakinra, dupilumab, and tralokinumab that target the IL-4/IL-13 signalling pathways in patients with eosinophilic asthma or raised serum periostin.  BACKGROUND: Moderate-to-severe asthma remains poorly treated.  We evaluated the efficacy and safety of dupilumab (SAR231893/REGN668), a fully human monoclonal antibody to the alpha subunit of the interleukin-4 receptor, in patients with persistent, moderate-to-severe asthma and elevated eosinophil levels.  With respect to immune dysregulation, dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody directed at the IL-4 receptor alpha subunit was recently shown to be effective in treating adults with moderate-to-severe AD.  Dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks interleukin-4 and interleukin-13, has shown efficacy in patients with asthma and elevated eosinophil levels.  We evaluated the efficacy and safety of dupilumab (SAR231893/REGN668), a fully human monoclonal antibody to the alpha subunit of the interleukin-4 receptor, in patients with persistent, moderate-to-severe asthma and elevated eosinophil levels.

"[SOC]###context: We have previously described a gene, Fxy , that spans the pseudoautosomal boundary in mice such that the first three exons of the gene are located on the X chromosome, but the remainder of the gene is located on both X and Y chromosomes.  Therefore, this gene might be in a state of transition between pseudoautosomal and X-unique locations.    Here, we report that the rate of sequence divergence of the 3' end of the Fxy gene is much higher (estimated at 170-fold higher for synonymous sites) when pseudoautosomal (present on both the X and Y chromosomes) than when X-unique.  Thus, chromosomal position can directly affect the rate of evolution of a gene.  The mouse Fxy gene was translocated into the highly recombining pseudoautosomal region comparatively recently in evolutionary terms.  This event resulted in a rapid increase of GC content.  These results strongly suggest that recombination is the primary determinant of the isochore organization of mammalian genomes.  Such an accelerated rate of evolution might be due to factors other than natural selection, in particular GC-biased gene conversion.  This is true of neutral sequences, but also of constrained sequences, which can be illustrated using the mouse Fxy gen

"[SOC]###context: In addition to RNA synthesis, multisubunit RNA polymerases (msRNAPs) support enzymatic reactions such as intrinsic transcript cleavage.  msRNAP active sites from different species appear to exhibit differential intrinsic transcript cleavage efficiency and have likely evolved to allow fine-tuning of the transcription process.  Here we show that a single amino-acid substitution in the trigger loop (TL) of Saccharomyces RNAP II, Rpb1 H1085Y, engenders a gain of intrinsic cleavage activity where the substituted tyrosine appears to participate in acid-base chemistry at alkaline pH for both intrinsic cleavage and nucleotidyl transfer.   The eukaryotic transcription factor TFIIS enhances elongation and nascent transcript cleavage activities of RNA polymerase II in a stalled elongation complex.  The transcription factor TFIIS zinc ribbon dipeptide Asp-Glu is critical for stimulation of elongation and RNA cleavage by RNA polymerase II By site-directed mutagenesis, we have demonstrated that invariant residues Asp-261 and Glu-262 of the nucleic acid-binding TFIIS Zn ribbon are critical for stimulation of both elongation and RNA cleavage activities of RNA polymerase II.  Complexes of yeast RNA polymerase II and RNA are substrates for TFIIS-induced RNA cleavage.  RNA in such RNA-RNA polymerase complexes undergoes reactions previously thought to be unique to nascent RNA in ternary complexes with DNA, including TFIIS-dependent cleavage and elongation by 3'-terminal addition of NMP from NTP.  Nascent RNA cleavage by arrested RNA polymerase II does not require upstream translocation of the elongation complex on DNA.  Here we show that in the presence of SII and nucleotides, transcript cleavage is detected during SII-dependent elongation but not during SII-independent transcription.   under typical transcription conditions, SII is necessary but insufficient to activate RNA cleavage.  RNA cleavage could serve to move RNA polymerase II away from the transcriptional impediment and/or permit RNA polymerase II multiple attempts at RNA elongation.  SII is an RNA polymerase II-binding protein that stimulates transcription elongation and also activates nascent transcript cleavage by RNA polymerase II in elongation complexes in vitro The RNA polymerase II elongation complex.  Factor-dependent transcription elongation involves nascent RNA cleavage.  Cleavage was not restricted to an elongation complex arrested at this particular site, showing that nascent RNA hydrolysis is a general property of RNA polymerase II elongation complexes.  Elongation factor SII (also known as TFIIS) is an RNA polymerase II binding protein that allows bypass of template arrest sites by activating a nascent RNA cleavage reaction.  During gene transcription, the RNA polymerase (Pol) active center can catalyze RNA cleavage.  During gene transcription, the RNA polymerase (Pol) active center can catalyze RNA cleavage.  The eukaryotic transcription factor TFIIS enhances elongation and nascent transcript cleavage activities of RNA polymerase II in a stalled elongation complex.  Rpb9, a small subunit of RNA polymerase II, enhances the cleavage stimulation activity of S-II.  These results suggest that both S-II and Rpb9 maintain transcriptional fidelity by stimulating the cleavage activity intrinsic to RNA polymerase II.  It is also possible that the transcript cleavage activity of RNA polymerase II represents a proofreading function of the enzyme. .

Distinct molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma, including hedgehog (Hh) pathway-activated disease, have been reported.   We assessed the antitumour activity of sonidegib, a Hedgehog signalling inhibitor, in patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma.  Among such pathways, RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, EGFR, and Notch are of particular interest because agents that selectively inhibit these pathways are available and can be readily combined with agents such as vismodegib, sonidegib (LDE225), and BMS-833923, which target smoothened-a key Hh pathway regulator.

This pooled analysis of four studies determined the level of association between uptake of the fibrillar amyloid β positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent [(18)F]flutemetamol (Pittsburgh Compound B analog with a 5. 5 times longer half-life to enable it to be used in the clinical setting)  is implicated in the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD).  We sought to determine the associations between beta amyloid (Aβ) plaque deposition in vivo using Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) and several indices of cholesterol homeostasis (i. e. , total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), clusterin, oxysterol metabolites of cholesterol, and previously reported genes associated with late-onset AD) in 175 nondemented elderly subjects.  High Aβ dep g biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease include amyloid deposition [imaged with [(11)C]Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET], altered glucose metabolism (imaged with [(18)F]fluro-deoxyglucose PET), and structural atrophy (imaged by MRI).  Recently we published the initial subset of imaging findings for specific regions in a cohort of individuals with autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease.  We now exte Criteria for preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD) propose β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques to initiate neurodegeneration within AD-affected regions.  However, some cognitively normal older individuals harbor neural injury similar to patients with AD, without concurrent Aβ burden.  Such findings challenge the proposed sequence and suggest that Aβ-independent precursors underlie AD-typical neurodegenerative patterns.  OBJECTIVE T ol is a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer for in vivo amyloid imaging.  The ability to classify amyloid scans in a binary manner as 'normal' versus 'Alzheimer-like', is of high clinical relevance.  We evaluated whether a supervised machine learning technique, support vector machines (SVM), can replicate the assignments made by visual readers blind to the clinical diagnosis, which image components have highest diagnostic value according to SVM and how (18)F-flutemetamol-based classification using SVM relates to structural MRI-based classification using SVM within the same subjects.  By means of SVM with a linear kernel, we analyzed (18)F-flutemetamol scans and volumetric MRI scans from 72 cases from the (18)F-flutemetamol phase 2 study (27 clinically probable Alzheimer's disease (AD), 20 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 25 controls).  In a leave-one-out approach, we trained the (18)F-flutemetamol based classifier by means of the visual reads and tested whether the classifier was able to reproduce the assignment based on visual reads and which voxels had the highest feature weights.  The (18)F-flutemetamol based classifier was able to replicate the assignments obtained by visual reads with 100% accuracy.  The voxels with highest feature weights were in the striatum, precuneus, cingulate and middle frontal gyrus.  Second, to determine concordance between the gray matter volume- and the (18)F-flutemetamol-based classification, we trained the classifier with the clinical diagnosis as gold standard.  Overall sensitivity of the (18)F-flutemetamol- and the gray matter volume-based classifiers were identical (85. 2%), albeit with discordant classification in three cases.  Specificity of the (18)F-flutemetamol based classifier was 92% compared to 68% for MRI.  In the MCI  disease (AD) is defined histologically by the presence of extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles in the cerebral cortex.  The diagnosis of dementia, along with the prediction of who will develop dementia, has been assisted by magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography (PET) by using [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG).  These techniques, however, are not specific for AD.  Based on the chemistry of histologic staining dyes, several Aβ-specific positron-emitting radiotracers have been developed to image neuropathology of AD.  Among these, [(11)C]PiB is the most studied Aβ-binding PET radiopharmaceutical in the world.  The histologic and biochemical specificity of PiB binding across different regions of the AD brain was demonstrated by showing a direct correlation between Aβ-containing amyloid plaques and in vivo [(11)C]PiB retention measured by PET imaging.  Because (11)C is not ideal for commercialization, several (18)F-labeled tracers have been developed.  At this time, [(18)F]3'-F-PiB (Flutemetamol), (18)F-AV-45 (Florbetapir), and (18)F-AV-1 (Florbetaben) are undergoing extensive phase II and III clinical trials.  This article provides a brief review of the amyloid biology and chemistry of Aβ-specific (11)C and (18)F-PET radiopharmaceuticals.  Clinical trials have clearly documented that PET radiopharmaceuticals capable of assessing Aβ content in vivo in the brains of AD subjects and subjects with mild cognitive impairment will be important as diagnostic agents to detect in vivo amyloid brain pathology.  In addition, is well known that many clinical and genetic factors have been associated with beta-amyloid deposition, few studies have examined the interactions of such factors across different stages of Alzheimer's pathogenesis.  METHODS: We used 18F-florbetapir F18 PET imaging to quantify neuritic beta-amyloid plaque density across four cortical regions in 602 elderly (55-94 years) subjects from the national ADNI biomarker study.  The group comprised of 194 normal elderly, 212 early mild cognitive impairment [EMCI], 132 late mild cognitive impairment [LMCI], and 64 mild Alzheimer's (AD).  FINDINGS: In a model incorporating multiple predictive factors, the effect of apolipoprotein E ε4 and diagnosis was significant on all four cortical regions.  The highest signals were seen in cingulate followed by frontal and parietal with lowest signals in temporal lobe (p<0. 0001).  The effect of apolipoprotein E ε4 (Cohen's D 0. 96) on beta-amyloid plaque density was approximately twice as large as the effect of a diagnosis of AD (Cohen's D 0. 51) and thrice as large as the effect of a diagnosis of LMCI (Cohen's D 0. 34) (p<0. 0001).  Surprisingly, ApoE ε4+ normal controls had greater mean plaque density across all cortical regions than ε4- EMCI and ε4- LMCI (p<0. 0001, p=0. 0009) and showed higher, though non-significant, mean value than ε4- AD patients (p<0. 27).  ApoE ε4+ EMCI and LMCI subjects had significantly greater mean plaque density across all cortical regions than ε4- AD patients (p<0. 027, p<0. 0001).  INTERPRETATION: Neuritic amyloid plaque load across progressive clinical stages of AD varies strongly by ApoE4 genotype.  These findings support the need for better pathology-based and supported diagnosis in routine practice.  Our data als sitron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers, fluorodeoxyglucose F 18 ((18)F-FDG) is the compound most widely used in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementias.  However, this compound shows a level of specificity and sensitivity for early Alzheimer's disease detection that is lower than that provided by high-affinity ligands for β-amyloid (Aβ).  Among the new widely available fluorine 18 ((18)F)-labeled Aβ ligands, florbetapir F 18 ((18))F-AV-45; Amyvid™) showed clear qualitative and quantitative correlations between in vivo PET imaging and postmortem histopathologic analysis of Aβ.  Florbetapir F 18 stands out for its high Aβ affinity and its pharmacokinetic properties that allow 10-minute PET scan imaging within 90 minutes after administration (dose = 370 MBq).  Importantly, no safety concerns for florbetapir F 18 were found in preclinical studies.  In 2012, the U. S.  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Amyvid as a radiotracer helpful for excluding the presence of Aβ in the brain.

###question: Which are the biotracers used for detection of Alzheimer's disease using PET?[EOC] [SOR]###response: Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) was the first radiotracer capable of highlighting deposits of beta-amyloid—one pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease—in living individuals during a PET scan.  The Alzheimer's Association helped fund early PIB development.  The Association in 2006 also awarded a $2. 1 million grant to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to expand this long-term, nationwide study to include PIB-PET imaging.   18F flutemetamol (flute), another radiotracer that highlights beta-amyloid in a PET scan, is structurally identical to PIB except for one fluorine atom in place of a carbon atom.  That small chemical change enables flutemetamol to remain stable significantly longer than does PIB, potentially increasing its usefulness outside research settings.

"[SOC]###context: The density of EAAC1 (EAAT3) glutamate transporters expressed by neurons in the mammalian CNS.  Glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST) and glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) are the most abundant subtypes and are essential for the functioning of the mammalian CNS, but the contribution of the EAAC1 subtype in the clearance of synaptic glutamate has remained controversial, because the density of this transporter in different tissues has not been determined.  Using immunofluorescence and postembedding immunogold labeling, we investigated the distributions of the glutamate-aspartate transporter (GLAST or excitatory amino acid transporter 1), vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT1), and the AMPA receptor glutamate receptor 4 (GluR4) along the spiral.   Immunogold labeling for GluR4 was confined to synaptic sites, represented by puncta in immunofluorescence.  The relative numbers of puncta changed with a gradient similar to that of GLAST labeling.  VGLUT1 labeling occurred in IHCs but showed no clear cochleotopic gradient.  These data suggest that both the density of innervation and the activity levels of glutamatergic synapses may be involved in modulating regional expression of GLAST.  In brain, EAAC1 (excitatory amino acid carrier 1) is the primary neuronal glutamate transporter, localized on the perisynaptic membranes that are near release sites.  Reticulon RTN2B regulates trafficking and function of neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1.  Previously, we identified an EAAC1-associated protein, GTRAP3-18, an ER protein that prevents ER exit of EAAC1 when induced Here we show that RTN2B, a member of the reticulon protein family that mainly localizes in the ER and ER exit sites interacts with EAAC1 and GTRAP3-18 In this study, uptake of L-[14C]cystine by three of the high affinity sodium-dependent mammalian glutamate transporters (GLT1, GLAST and EAAC1) individually expressed in HEK cells has been determined Reduction of L-[14C]cystine to L-[14C]cysteine in the presence of 1mM cysteinylglycine increases the uptake rate in HEK(GLT1), HEK(GLAST) and HEK(EAAC1) cells, but only a small proportion (<10%) of L-[14C]cysteine uptake in HEK(GLT1) and HEK(GLAST) cells occurs by the high affinity glutamate transporters Position of the third Na+ site in the aspartate transporter GltPh and the human glutamate transporter, EAAT1.

We studied the subunit stoichiometry of two distantly related glutamate transporters, the human glial glutamate transporter hEAAT2 and a bacterial glutamate transporter from Escherichia coli, ecgltP.  Using blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, analysis of concatenated transporters, and chemical cross-linking, we demonstrated that human and prokaryotic glutamate transporters expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes or in mammalian cells are assembled as trimers composed of three identical subunits.  Five glutamate transporters in the human brain (EAAT1-5) are present on both astroglia and neurons.  We characterize the profile of three different human astroglial progenitors in vitro: human glial restricted precursors (HGRP), human astrocyte precursors (HAPC), and early-differentiated astrocytes.  They are known to be multimers; however, the number of subunits forming a functional transporter is controversial.

"[SOC]###context: Loss-of-function nuclear factor κB subunit 1 (NFKB1) variants are the most common monogenic cause of common variable immunodeficiency in Europeans.  The genetic cause of primary immunodeficiency disease (PID) carries prognostic information. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a whole-genome sequencing study assessing a large proportion of the NIHR BioResource-Rare Diseases cohort. METHODS: In the predominantly European study population of principally sporadic unrelated PID cases (n = 846), a novel Bayesian method identified nuclear factor κB subunit 1 (NFKB1) as one of the genes most strongly associated with PID, and the association was explained by 16 novel heterozygous truncating, missense, and gene deletion variants.  This accounted for 4% of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) cases (n = 390) in the cohort.  Amino acid substitutions predicted to be pathogenic were assessed by means of analysis of structural protein data.  Immunophenotyping, immunoblotting, and ex vivo stimulation of lymphocytes determined the functional effects of these variants.  Detailed clinical and pedigree information was collected for genotype-phenotype cosegregation analyses.  We show that heterozygous loss-of-function variants in NFKB1 are the most common known monogenic cause of CVID, which results in a temporally progressive defect in the formation of immunoglobulin-producing B cells.  Monoallelic loss-of-function mutations in NFKB1 were recently recognized as the most common monogenic cause of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID).

"[SOC]###context: In pediatric patients who had undergone PBT, the LAR of PBT was significantly lower than the LAR of IMXT estimated by in silico modeling.   Proton beam therapy (PBT) is a potential new alternative to treatment with photon radiotherapy that may reduce the risk of late toxicity and secondary cancer, especially for pediatric tumors.  No malignant secondary tumors occurred within the irradiated field.  The 10- and 20-year cumulative rates for all secondary tumors, malignant secondary tumors, and malignant nonhematologic secondary tumors were 8% and 16%, 5% and 13%, and 3% and 11%, respectively.  Our data indicate that PBT has the potential to reduce the risk of late mortality and secondary malignancy.  However, treatment-related toxicities have also occurred, particularly for radiotherapy, after which secondary cancer, reduced function of irradiated organs, and retarded growth are significant problems.  Proton beam therapy (PBT) is a particle radiotherapy with excellent dose localization that permits treatment of liver and lung cancer by administration of a high dose to the tumor while minimizing damage to surrounding normal tissues.   Notably, proton beam therapy is very useful for pediatric cancer; since the pediatric radiation dose to normal tissues should be reduced as much as possible because of the effect of radiation on growth, intellectual development, endocrine organ function and secondary cancer development.   After proton beam therapy (low-LET radiation), the risk of secondary cancer induction, relative to photons, can be divided by a factor of 3, due to the reduction of integral dose (as an average).   However, after heavy-ion beam therapy, the risk should be divided by 3, as after proton therapy due to the excellent physical selectivity of the irradiation.   Proton beam therapy (PT) offers improved sparing of normal tissue, thus potentially reducing the risk for treatment related late sequelae and induction of secondary cancer.   INTRODUCTION: The concern of secondary cancer induction and normal tissue complications have motivated a more frequent use of protons in radiotherapy (RT) of children.   However, activation, neutron production, and the associated secondary cancer risk in proton beam should be an important consideration which is evaluated.  RESULTS: In all evaluated organs, the mean dose in PBT was 20-80% of that in CRT.  The risk of secondary cancer in PBT was 24-83% of that in CRT for five organs, but 121% of that in CRT for pancreas.   Assessments of secondary cancer risk showed that PBT reduces the risk of secondary cancer in most organs, whereas IMRT is associated with a higher risk than CRT.  A recent study suggested reduced secondary cancer and other late toxicities after proton beam therapy (PBT) due to dosimetric advantages.  After proton beam therapy (low-LET radiation), the risk of secondary cancer induction, relative to photons, can be divided by a factor of 3, due to the reduction of integral dose (as an average).  The incidence of secondary malignancies after proton beam therapy is low but not negligible, therefore, it must be taken into account when planning a treatment as secondary tumors may present with a highly aggressive behaviour.  We show that compared with photon therapy, proton therapy markedly reduces the risk of secondary malignancies and for equivalent dosing regimens achieves better tumour control as well as a reduced primary recurrence outcome, especially within a hypo-fractionated regimen.  Purpose: Proton radiotherapy (PRT) is potentially associated with a lower risk for secondary malignancies due to a decreased integral dose to the surrounding organs at risk (OARs).  Our data indicate that PBT has the potential to reduce the risk of late mortality and secondary malignancy.  The total lifetime risk of second cancer due exclusively to stray radiation was 1. 5% for the passively scattered treatment versus 0. 8% for the scanned proton beam treatment.  In general, the risk for developing a second malignancy in out-of-field organs for PBS remains much lower compared to PPT even if apertures are being applied.  CONCLUSIONS: PBS PT is associated to significant SCR reduction in BC patients compared to photon radiotherapy.   Calculations of out-of-field organ doses following a brain tumor treatment indicated that proton PBS therapy of brain tumors is associated with a low risk of radiation-induced cancer.  CONCLUSIONS: When considering exposure to primary and secondary radiation, proton therapy can reduce the risk of an SMN in prostate patients compared with contemporary IMRT.  CONCLUSION: The findings of this study indicate that the risks of radiation-induced secondary cancers after radiosurgery of liver metastases may be reduced, if IMPT is used instead of photon-beam based SBRT.  Clinical data are emerging supporting the lower incidence of secondary malignancies after PRT compared with historical photon data, though longer follow-up in proton treated cohorts is awaited.  However, proton treatment can result in a lower cancer incidence than photon treatment.

"[SOC]###context: Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors have a conserved function in regulating metazoan lifespan.  In contrast to FoxO1, FoxO3a and FoxO6 were specifically diminished in the CNS of HFD animals possibly contributing to the reduced lifespan observed in these animals.  Interestingly, many target proteins of AMPK are so-called longevity factors, e. g. , SIRT1, p53, and FoxOs, which not only can increase the stress resistance and extend the lifespan of many organisms but also inhibit the inflammatory responses.   Components of anti-ageing and autophagy include SirTs and FoxOs.  Since Sirts and FoxOs are reliable markers of longevity, the results appear to suggest that Longevinex induces longevity after prolonged feeding via induction of autophagy, while it converts death signals into survival signals and provides cardioprotection within a relatively shorter period of time.  Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors are involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, stress resistance, metabolism, and longevity In this respect, members of the mammalian forkhead transcription factors of the O class (FoxOs) that include FoxO1, FoxO3, FoxO4 and FoxO6 are increasingly being recognized as exciting prospects for multiple disorders.  These transcription factors govern development, proliferation, survival and longevity during multiple cellular environments that can involve oxidative stress.   Here we discuss the fascinating but complex role of FoxOs during cellular injury and oxidative stress, progenitor cell development, fertility, angiogenesis, cardiovascular function, cellular metabolism and diabetes, cell longevity, immune surveillance and cancer.  Many longevity genes, e. g.  FoxOs and SIRT1, are inhibitors of NF-kappaB signaling.   Interestingly, several longevity genes such as SIRT1, SIRT6, and FoxOs can clearly suppress NF-kappaB signaling and in this way delay the aging process and extend lifespan.  Yet, FoxOs also can significantly affect normal cell survival and longevity, requiring new treatments for neoplastic growth to modulate novel pathways that integrate cell proliferation, metabolism, inflammation and survival.  These observations link FoxO function in mammalian systems with the evolutionarily conserved role of FoxO in promotion of stress resistance and longevity in lower phylogenetic systems.  Furthermore, these findings have implications for aging in higher organisms and in malignant stem cell biology, and suggest that FoxOs may play an important role in the maintenance and integrity of stem cell compartments in a broad spectrum of tissues.  Forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factors are important downstream targets of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and crucial regulators of cell fate.  This function of FoxOs relies on their ability to control diverse cellular functions, including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, DNA repair, defense against oxidative stress and ageing.  This brief review focuses on the molecular mechanisms, cellular effects and resulting organismal phenotypes generated by differentially regulated FoxO proteins and discusses our current understanding of the role of FoxOs in disease and ageing processes.  In this review, we focus on the several interactions of aging-associated signaling cascades regulated either by Sirtuins and FoxOs or NF-kappaB signaling pathways.  We provide evidence that signaling via the longevity factors of FoxOs and SIRT1 can inhibit NF-kappaB signaling and simultaneously protect against inflamm-aging process.  In diverse species transcription factors belonging to the forkhead/winged helix box gene, group O (FOXO) subfamily have been found to be crucial in downstream suppression of the life-shortening effects of insulin/insulin-like growth factor-I receptor signalling pathways that, when upregulated, accelerate ageing by suppression of FOXO.   In humans, FOXO3a, as well as FOXO1 and -4, and their downstream effectors, could hold the key to counteracting ageing and common diseases.  FOXO transcription factors have important roles in metabolism, cellular proliferation, stress tolerance, and aging.

"[SOC]###context: Among the deadenylase family, poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) is unique in its domain composition, which contains three potential RNA-binding domains: the catalytic nuclease domain, the R3H domain and the RRM domain On the other hand, the interaction between CNOT7 and BTG2, a member of the antiproliferative BTG/Tob family involved in transcription and mRNA decay appears less important for proliferation of MCF7 cells, suggesting that CNOT7 does not function solely in conjunction with BTG2.  The Tob/BTG family is a group of antiproliferative proteins containing two highly homologous regions, Box A and Box B.  These proteins all associate with CCR4-associated factor 1 (Caf1), which belongs to the ribonuclease D (RNase D) family of deadenylases and is a component of the CCR4-Not deadenylase complex.  The CCR4 family proteins are 3'-5'-deadenylases that function in the first step of the degradation of poly(A) mRNA.  CCR4, an evolutionarily conserved member of the CCR4-NOT complex, is the main cytoplasmic deadenylase.  It contains a C-terminal nuclease domain with homology to the endonuclease-exonuclease-phosphatase (EEP) family of enzymes.  The yeast Pop2 protein, belonging to the eukaryotic Caf1 family, is required for mRNA deadenylation in vivo.  Although CAF1 protein belongs to the DEDDh family of RNases, CCR4 appears to be the principle deadenylase of the CCR4-NOT complex.  Like CCR4, increased length of RNA substrates converted mCAF1 into a processive enzyme.  In contrast to two other DEDD family members, PAN2 and PARN, mCAF1 was not activated either by PAB1 or capped RNA substrates.  The domain has the fold of the DnaQ family and represents the first structure of an RNase from the DEDD superfamily.  The evolutionarily conserved CCR4 protein, which is part of the cytoplasmic deadenylase, contains a C-terminal domain that displays homology to an Mg2+-dependent DNase/phosphatase family of proteins.  These results establish that CCR4 and most probably other members of a widely distributed CCR4-like family of proteins constitute a novel class of RNA-DNA exonucleases.  Deadenylases specifically catalyze the degradation of eukaryotic mRNA poly(A) tail in the 3'- to 5'-end direction with the release of 5'-AMP as the product.  Shortening and removal of the 3' poly(A) tail of mature mRNA by poly(A)-specific 3' exonucleases (deadenylases) is the initial and often rate-limiting step in mRNA degradation.  PARN, Nocturnin and Angel are three of the multiple deadenylases that have been described in eukaryotic cells.

"[SOC]###context: Role of the Hof1-Cyk3 interaction in cleavage-furrow ingression and primary-septum formation during yeast cytokinesis.  In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it is well established that Hof1, Cyk3, and Inn1 contribute to septum formation and cytokinesis.  Because hof1∆ and cyk3∆ single mutants have relatively mild defects but hof1∆ cyk3∆ double mutants are nearly dead, it has been hypothesized that these proteins contribute to parallel pathways.  However, there is also evidence that they interact physically.  In this study, we examined this interaction and its functional significance in detail.  Our data indicate that the interaction 1) is mediated by a direct binding of the Hof1 SH3 domain to a proline-rich motif in Cyk3; 2) occurs specifically at the time of cytokinesis but is independent of the (hyper)phosphorylation of both proteins that occurs at about the same time; 3) is dispensable for the normal localization of both proteins; 4) is essential for normal primary-septum formation and a normal rate of cleavage-furrow ingression; and 5) becomes critical for growth when either Inn1 or the type II myosin Myo1 (a key component of the contractile actomyosin ring) is absent.  The similarity in phenotype between cyk3∆ mutants and mutants specifically lacking the Hof1-Cyk3 interaction suggests that the interaction is particularly important for Cyk3 function, but it may be important for Hof1 function as well.

"[SOC]###context: Non-invasive prenatal testing using cell-free fetal DNA in maternal circulation The identification of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal circulation has made non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) possible.  In recent years, technical advances in the molecular analysis of fetal DNA (e. g. , digital PCR and massively parallel sequencing (MPS)) has enabled the successful implementation of noninvasive testing into clinical practice, such as fetal sex assessment, RhD genotyping, and fetal chromosomal aneuploidy detection. With the ability to decipher the entire fetal genome from maternal plasma DNA, we foresee that an increased number of non-invasive prenatal tests will be available for detecting many single-gene disorders in the near future.  This review briefly summarizes the technical aspects of the NIPT and application of NIPT in clinical practice.  First identified in 1997, cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) has just recently been used to detect fetal aneuploidy of chromosomes 13, 18, and 21, showing its potential to revolutionize prenatal genetic testing as a non-invasive screening tool To determine how adults in the United States view non-invasive prenatal testing using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA testing) in order to help estimate uptake Non-invasive prenatal testing of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal plasma can predict the fetal RhD type in D negative pregnant women The identification of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal circulation has made non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) possible The effectiveness and clinical utility of non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) for fetal sex determination using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) was assessed by undertaking a prospective national audit of UK testing The recent release of new, non-invasive prenatal tests for fetal aneuploidy using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) has been hailed as a revolution in prenatal testing and has triggered significant commercial interest in the field Non-invasive prenatal aneuploidy testing that utilizes cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) circulating in maternal blood is one example of an innovative technology that promises significant benefits for its intended end users; however, it is currently uncertain whether it will achieve widespread clinical implementation Analysis of cell free fetal (cff) DNA in maternal plasma is used routinely for non invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) of fetal sex determination, fetal rhesus D status and some single gene disorders Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal plasma is an alternative to invasive prenatal diagnosis (IPD), which carries a 1% risk of miscarriage.   The recent release of new, non-invasive prenatal tests for fetal aneuploidy using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) has been hailed as a revolution in prenatal testing and has triggered significant commercial interest in the field.   The effectiveness and clinical utility of non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) for fetal sex determination using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) was assessed by undertaking a prospective national audit of UK testing.   NIFTY (Non-invasive Fetal Trisomy Test) is a non-invasive prenatal test which is used for diagnosing fetal trisomy.  The test is based on the analysis of cell free fetal DNA (cffDNA) present in the plasma and serum of a pregnant woman.  Using non-invasive method of cffDNAs in the shortest time possible, as well as avoiding invasive tests for early determination of fetal gender, provides the opportunity of deciding and employing early treatment for fetuses at risk of genetic diseases.  The identification of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal circulation has made non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) possible.  To determine how adults in the United States view non-invasive prenatal testing using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA testing) in order to help estimate uptake.  Nowadays, new advances in the use of cell free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal plasma of pregnant women has provided the possibility of applying cffDNA in prenatal diagnosis as a non-invasive method.  Non-invasive prenatal testing of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal plasma can predict the fetal RhD type in D negative pregnant women.  Prevention of contamination following our anti-contamination criteria is a good practice for certain non-invasive sex determination, using cffDNA.

"[SOC]###context: GeneComp, a new reference-based compressor for SAM files The most popular format for genomic data is the SAM format, which contains information such as alignment, quality values, etc.  These files are large (on the order of terabytes), which necessitates compression.  In this work we propose a new reference-based compressor for SAM files, which can accommodate different levels of compression, based on the specific needs of the user.  In particular, the proposed compressor GeneComp allows the user to perform lossy compression of the quality scores, which have been proven to occupy more than half of the compressed file (when losslessly compressed).  We show that the proposed compressor GeneComp overall achieves better compression ratios than previously proposed algorithms when working on lossless mode.  The enormous size of these data motivates the development of data compression algorithms usable for the implementation of the various storage policies that are applied to the produced intermediate and final result files.  In this article, we present NGC, a tool for the compression of mapped short read data stored in the wide-spread SAM format.  NGC enables lossless and lossy compression and introduces the following two novel ideas: first, we present a way to reduce the number of required code words by exploiting common features of reads mapped to the same genomic positions; second, we present a highly configurable way for the quantization of per-base quality values, which takes their influence on downstream analyses into account.  NGC, evaluated with several real-world data sets, saves 33-66% of disc space using lossless and up to 98% disc space using lossy compression.  By applying two popular variant and genotype prediction tools to the decompressed data, we could show that the lossy compression modes preserve>99% of all called variants while outperforming comparable methods in some configurations.  Research in bioinformatics primarily involves collection and analysis of a large volume of genomic data.  Naturally, it demands efficient storage and transfer of this huge amount of data.  In recent years, some research has been done to find efficient compression algorithms to reduce the size of various sequencing data.  One way to improve the transmission time of large files is to apply a maximum lossless compression on them.  In this paper, we present SAMZIP, a specialized encoding scheme, for sequence alignment data in SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format, which improves the compression ratio of existing compression tools available.  Recent advancements in sequencing technology have led to a drastic reduction in the cost of sequencing a genome.  This has generated an unprecedented amount of genomic data that must be stored, processed and transmitted.  To facilitate this effort, we propose a new lossy compressor for the quality values presented in genomic data files (e. g.  FASTQ and SAM files), which comprise roughly half of the storage space (in the uncompressed domain).  Lossy compression allows for compression of data beyond its lossless limit. RESULTS: The proposed algorithm QVZ exhibits better rate-distortion performance than the previously proposed algorithms, for several distortion metrics and for the lossless case.  Moreover, it allows the user to define any quasi-convex distortion function to be minimized, a feature not supported by the previous algorithms.  Finally, we show that QVZ-compressed data exhibit better performance in the genotyping than data compressed with previously proposed algorithms, in the sense that for a similar rate, a genotyping closer to that achieved with the original quality values is obtained.  In this paper, we present SAMZIP, a specialized encoding scheme, for sequence alignment data in SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format, which improves the compression ratio of existing compression tools available.  We describe CSAM (Compressed SAM format), a compression approach offering lossless and lossy compression for SAM files.  GeneComp, a new reference-based compressor for SAM files.

On the loci of two developmental transcription factor genes, SOX3 and PAX6, we demonstrate that HCNEs conserved between human and zebrafish can be systematically and reliably tested for their regulatory function in multiple stable transgenes in zebrafish, and their genomic reach estimated with confidence using synteny conservation and HCNE density along these loci.  HCNEs of both human and zebrafish function as specific developmental enhancers in zebrafish We show that human HCNEs result in expression patterns in zebrafish equivalent to those in mouse, establishing zebrafish as a suitable model for large-scale testing of human developmental enhancers HCNEs from the same area often drive overlapping patterns, suggesting that multiple regulatory inputs are required to achieve robust and precise complex expression patterns exhibited by developmental genes Organization of conserved elements near key developmental regulators in vertebrate genomes Further positional analysis of these conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) in the genome demonstrates that they cluster around genes involved in developmental regulation Ancora: a web resource for exploring highly conserved noncoding elements and their association with developmental regulatory genes Metazoan genomes contain arrays of highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) that span developmental regulatory genes and define regulatory domains The most highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) in mammalian genomes cluster within regions enriched for genes encoding developmentally important transcription factors (TFs).

This case shows a similar impact on bone health in a young male resulting in low bone mineral density for age based on Z-score.  This case report highlights the possible mechanisms for the bone loss in the setting of prolactinoma and the need for assessing bone health in such patients.   Hyperprolactinaemia related to prolactinoma significantly (more than functional hyperprolactiaemia) increases the risk of osteopenia, osteoporosis and bone fractures.   Prolactinomas are the most common type of functional pituitary tumor.  Effective hyperprolactinemia treatment is of great importance, due to its potential deleterious effects including infertility, gonadal dysfunction and osteoporosis.   Prolactinomas cause hypogonadism, infertility, osteoporosis, and tumor mass effects, and are the most common type of neuroendocrine tumor.  We present a 22-year-old man with multiple osteoporotic fractures associated with prolactinoma despite the use of teriparatide for 18 months.  We emphasize and highlight the importance of hyperprolactinemia and fractures caused by high prolactin levels.  OBJECTIVE: Patients with prolactinoma seem to be at high risk for osteopenia.   RESULTS: Compared to the matched controls, BMD of patients with prolactinoma or craniopharyngioma significantly decreased.   CONCLUSION: In the premenopausal women, patients with prolactinoma or craniopharyngioma are often accompanied with osteopenia or osteoporosis, and disease duration and hypogonadism are the risk factors of bone loss in prolactinoma.  Data on osteoporotic fractures in hyperprolactinemia are limited.  An increased prevalence of radiological vertebral fractures was recently observed in women with prolactin (PRL)-secreting adenoma, whereas it is unknown whether this observation may reflect a more general increased risk of fractures in this disease and whether the prevalence of fractures in males is affected by gonadal status.

Prolactinoma in old people may present insidiously with chronic anaemia and osteoporosis with or without sexual dysfunction.

"[SOC]###context: Should the annular tendon of the eye be named 'annulus of Zinn' or 'of Valsalva'? The annular tendon is commonly named 'annulus of Zinn', from the German anatomist and botanist Johann Gottfried Zinn (1727-1759) who described this structure in his Descriptio anatomica oculi humani (Anatomical Description of the Human Eye, 1755).  It arose at the annulus of Zinn, passing forwards between the inferior rectus muscle and lateral rectus muscle, and insert directly on the sclera.   Drilling was continued toward the annulus of Zinn (AZ) and optic nerve superiorly and over the intracavernous ICA posteriorly.  Measurements before and after resection of the ACP included the length of C6 segment of the ICA on its lateral aspect; C6 segment length on its medial aspect; and medial length of the optic nerve from the optic chiasm to falciform ligament (before ACP resection) then to the annulus of Zinn (after ACP resection).  The muscles, situated between the optic nerve and the lateral rectus muscle, originated from the annulus of Zinn and branched off two heads; one inserted into the medial inferior side of the superior rectus muscle and the other inserted into the central superior side of the inferior rectus muscle.    In 30 cadavers, the superior division of the oculomotor nerve was severed en bloc 1. 5 cm anterior to the annulus of Zinn with the levator palpebrae superioris (LPS) and the superior rectus muscles.   The optic canal was subsequently removed en bloc, beginning at the annulus of Zinn and extending to the optic chiasm.  PURPOSE: To describe a combined transcranial-orbital approach for en bloc resection of optic nerve gliomas with preservation of the annulus of Zinn that minimizes recurrence and prevents postoperative paralytic ptosis. DESIGN: A retrospective, noncomparative, interventional case series.

No patients had tumor recurrence or developed postoperative paralytic ptosis. CONCLUSIONS: The combined transcranial-orbital approach with preservation of the annulus of Zinn is a safe and effective way to remove optic nerve gliomas and ensure tumor clearance while avoiding paralytic ptosis.

Fifty-three (13 %) women had antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant and/or anti-beta2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies) mainly associated with the risk of spontaneous abortion during the first trimester thrombophilia was found to be considerably more common in women with pregnancy-associated complications in comparison with the general population, and most frequently in conjunction with venous thromboembolism during pregnancy and the postpartum period When counseling white women with a history of preeclampsia, screening for thrombophilia can be useful for preconceptional counseling and pregnancy management.  knowledge combined with the appropriate use of thromboprophylaxis and treatment in women who have objectively confirmed VTE continue to improve maternal and perinatal outcomes The risk of having thrombophilia is doubled in men who have fathered pregnancies which ended in perinatal death as well as in the mothers of such pregnancies.  The prevalence of thrombophilic variants is of possible public health significance for other morbidity; but perhaps not in relation to preeclampsia This study suggests that thrombophilia ""mediates"" in lowering of cardiovascular risk factors in women with a history of preeclampsia

"[SOC]###context: Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) resolve the phylogeny of Australasian smurf-weevils.  Here, we employ ultraconserved elements (UCEs) designed for beetles and a novel partitioning strategy of loci to help resolve phylogenetic relationships within the radiation of Australasian smurf-weevils (Eupholini).  Despite being emblematic of the New Guinea fauna, no previous phylogenetic studies have been conducted on the Eupholini.  In addition to a comprehensive collection of fresh specimens, we supplement our taxon sampling with museum specimens, and this study is the first target enrichment phylogenomic dataset incorporating beetle specimens from museum collections.  We use both concatenated and species tree analyses to examine the relationships and taxonomy of this group.  For species tree analyses we present a novel partitioning strategy to better model the molecular evolutionary process in UCEs.  We found that the current taxonomy is problematic, largely grouping species on the basis of similar color patterns.  Finally, our results show that most loci required multiple partitions for nucleotide rate substitution, suggesting that single partitions may not be the optimal partitioning strategy to accommodate rate heterogeneity for UCE loci.  Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) resolve the phylogeny of Australasian smurf-weevils. Weevils (Curculionoidea) comprise one of the most diverse groups of organisms on earth.

"[SOC]###context: Cranial radiotherapy improves survival of the most common childhood cancers, including brain tumors and leukemia.  Unfortunately, long-term survivors are faced with consequences of secondary neoplasia, including radiation-induced meningiomas (RIMs).   Combined chemotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation has improved the prognosis of children with acute leukemia.  However cranial irradiation carries a latent risk of the induction of secondary intracranial tumors.  We encountered a patient who developed multiple intracranial radiation-induced meningiomas (RIMs) 25 years after prophylactic cranial irradiation for the treatment of acute leukemia in childhood.   Focal cranial hyperostosis from meningioma: a complication from previous radiation treatment for childhood T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  Presented is a case of a 20 year man with a history of T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia diagnosed at age 22 months, treated with chemotherapy and cranial irradiation.  He had developed increasing prominence of the top of his head over several months.  Plain radiograph showed frontal calvarium thickening with focal ""hair-on-end"" periosteal reaction.  Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an enhancing dural-based mass with transcalvarial extension, confirmed after resection to be meningioma (World Health Organization Grade I).   RESULTS: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n = 186), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; n = 69), and nonmeningioma brain tumor (n = 116) were the most common types of SMNs and had the poorest outcome (5-year survival rate, 18. 1% ± 2. 9%, 31. 1% ± 6. 2%, and 18. 3% ± 3. 8%, respectively).   Radiation-induced World Health Organization grade II meningiomas in young patients following prophylactic cranial irradiation for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in childhood.  Three case reports.  Current chemotherapeutic regimens have been used to successfully treat many children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but have resulted in an increased risk of late central nervous system tumors, most commonly meningioma, particularly in patients who have received cranial irradiation.

Intraventricular meningioma after cranial irradiation for childhood leukemia.  Radiation-induced meningiomas may also have predilection to recur.  The authors describe a case of an intraventricular meningioma occurring 23 years after cranial irradiation for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  Cumulative incidence at 30 years after the childhood cancer diagnosis was 20. 5% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 19. 1% to 21. 8%) for all subsequent neoplasms, 7. 9% (95% CI = 7. 2% to 8. 5%) for second malignant neoplasms (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer), 9. 1% (95% CI = 8. 1% to 10. 1%) for nonmelanoma skin cancer, and 3. 1% (95% CI = 2. 5% to 3. 8%) for meningioma.   Radiation-induced meningiomas: a shadow in the success story of childhood leukemia.  Although the cohort is small, it seems probable that the increasing incidence of meningioma will shadow the future of cranially irradiated leukemia survivors.

The overall complication rate was 14. 6% (95% CI 11. 8-17. 7) including carpal tunnel syndrome or change in sensibility in 5. 2% and tendon complications in 4. 7%.   BACKGROUND: Although median nerve neuropathy and carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) are known complications of both untreated and acutely treated distal radius fracture, median neuropathy after correction of distal radius malunion is not commonly reported in hand surgery literature.   Complications were defined as malunion, carpal tunnel syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), persistent pain, and subjective cosmetic deformity of the wrist.

"[SOC]###context: Phase I, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Single-dose, and Multiple-dose Studies of Erenumab in Healthy Subjects and Patients With Migraine.  Erenumab was generally well tolerated, with an acceptable safety profile, supporting further clinical development of erenumab for migraine prevention.  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway have been developed for episodic and chronic migraine prevention, either through binding the CGRP ligand (eptinezumab, fremanezumab, galcanezumab) or the CGRP receptor (erenumab).  Erenumab, a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor, is being evaluated for migraine prevention.   Conclusions As a preventive treatment of episodic migraine, erenumab at a dosage of 70 mg monthly significantly reduced migraine frequency and acute migraine-specific medication use.   CGRP receptor antagonists such as ubrogepant are effective for acute relief of migraine headache, whereas monoclonal antibodies against CGRP (eptinezumab, fremanezumab and galcanezumab) or the CGRP receptor (erenumab) effectively prevent migraine attacks.   Estimating the clinical effectiveness and value-based price range of erenumab for the prevention of migraine in patients with prior treatment failures: a US societal perspective.  CONCLUSION: Erenumab is predicted to reduce migraine-related direct and indirect costs, and increase QALYs compared to SC.  Four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the CGRP pathway are currently under evaluation for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine: eptinezumab (ALD403), fremanezumab (TEV-48125), galcanezumab (LY2951742), and erenumab (AMG334).   Amgen and Novartis are developing erenumab (AIMOVIG™, erenumab-aooe)-a fully human monoclonal antibody calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist-for the prevention of migraine.

"[SOC]###context: In RA patients eligible for biological treatment included in the BiOCURA registry, 53 inflammatory proteins were measured using xMAP® technology.  Several studies have employed microarray-based profiling to predict response to tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors (TNFi) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA); yet efforts to validate these targets have failed to show predictive abilities acceptable for clinical practice. METHODS: The eighty most extreme responders and nonresponders to TNFi therapy were selected from the observational BiOCURA cohort.   In the metabolomic profiling, lipids, oxylipins, and amines were measured in serum samples of RA patients from the observational BiOCURA cohort, before start of biological treatment.  In clinical practice, approximately one-third of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) respond insufficiently to TNF-α inhibitors (TNFis).

"[SOC]###context: A group of mice was treated with debutyl-dronedarone (DBD), a selective TRα1 inhibitor (AMI-DBD) Furthermore, AMI resulted in β-myosin heavy chain overexpression and reduction in the ratio of SR(Ca)ATPase to phospholamban (PLB).  The latter further declined in AMI-DBD mainly due to increased expression of PLB We identified that mice expressing the mutant TRalpha1R384C (TRalpha1+m mice) displayed a mild bradycardia, which becomes more pronounced during night activity or on stress and is accompanied by a reduced expression of nucleotide-gated potassium channel 2 mRNA in the heart KCNE1 was four to 10-fold overexpressed in mice deficient in TRalpha1 The bradycardia and prolonged QT(end) time in hypothyroid states can be explained by altered K(+) channel function due to decreased TRalpha1-dependent repression of KCNE1 expression Consistently, TR alpha 1-infected myocytes exhibited larger I(f) current densities along with increased HCN2 and HCN4 mRNA and protein levels.  T3 stimulation enhanced KCND2 and KCND3 expression and decreased KCNA4 transcription, while KCNIP2 remained unaffected.  TRalpha1 increased I(to), while TRbeta1 significantly reduced I(to) in size, which was associated with TRalpha1-mediated increase and TRbeta1-mediated reduction of KCND2/3 transcription.  While the TRalpha1 aporeceptor enhanced KCND3 transcription, the TRbeta1 aporeceptor suppressed KCND3 expression, with both effects exhibiting ligand-dependent amplification upon T3 stimulation.  PE, in the absence of T3, resulted in 5. 0 fold increase in TRalpha1 expression in nucleus and 2. 0 fold decrease in TRalpha1 expression in cytosol, P<0. 05.  As a result, a fetal pattern of myosin isoform expression with marked expression of beta-MHC was observed in PE treated vs the untreated cells, P<0. 05.  PKC alpha overexpression in cardiomyocytes caused marked repression of triiodothyronine (T3)-responsive genes, alpha-myosin heavy chain, and the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium-activated adenosinetriphosphatase SERCA2.  Treatment with T3 for 4 h resulted in significant reductions of PKC alpha in nuclear and cytosolic compartments, and decreased TR alpha1 mRNA and protein, with normalization of phenotype.  The mechanism of TH and TRalpha1-specific hypertrophy is novel for a nuclear hormone receptor and involves the transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase (TAK1) and p38 Excised TRalpha(1)+/m hearts showed an increased expression of phospholamban (PLB) administration of dronedarone, an amiodarone-like compound that has been shown to preferentially antagonize thyroid hormone binding to thyroid hormone receptor alpha1 (TRalpha1), lpha-Myosin heavy chain (alpha-MHC) decreased in DRON while beta-myosin heavy chain (beta-MHC) and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) expression (SERCA) was similar to CONT.  The activity of TR DNA binding to the transcriptional regulatory region in the alpha-MHC and SR Ca(2+)-ATPase genes and the mRNA and protein expression of alpha-MHC and SR Ca(2+)-ATPase in the heart and plasma 3,3'-triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels were altered in association with changes in the myocardial TR protein levels.  addition, TR cotransfection and treatment with the TRbeta1-selective agonist GC-1 suggested different functional coupling of the TR isoforms, TRbeta1 to transcription of beta-MyHC, SERCA, and TRbeta1, and TRalpha1 to alpha-MyHC transcription and increased myocyte size OBJECTIVE: The reduced heart rate and prolonged QT(end) duration in mice deficient in thyroid hormone receptor (TR) alpha1 may involve aberrant expression of the K(+) channel alpha-subunit KCNQ1 and its regulatory beta-subunit KCNE1.

"[SOC]###context: BACKGROUND: Progesterone has been associated with robust positive effects in animal models of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and with clinical benefits in two phase 2 randomized, controlled trials.   The proportion of patients with a favorable outcome on the Glasgow Outcome Scale (good recovery or moderate disability) was 50. 4% with progesterone, as compared with 50. 5% with placebo.  Mortality was similar in the two groups.  No relevant safety differences were noted between progesterone and placebo.  CONCLUSIONS: Primary and secondary efficacy analyses showed no clinical benefit of progesterone in patients with severe TBI.  These data stand in contrast to the robust preclinical data and results of early single-center trials that provided the impetus to initiate phase 3 trials.  BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability worldwide.  Progesterone has been shown to improve neurologic outcome in multiple experimental models and two early-phase trials involving patients with TBI.   There was no significant difference between the progesterone group and the placebo group in the proportion of patients with a favorable outcome (relative benefit of progesterone, 0. 95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0. 85 to 1. 06; P=0. 35).  Phlebitis or thrombophlebitis was more frequent in the progesterone group than in the placebo group (relative risk, 3. 03; CI, 1. 96 to 4. 66).   CONCLUSIONS: This clinical trial did not show a benefit of progesterone over placebo in the improvement of outcomes in patients with acute TBI.   Numerous studies, however, show that progesterone has substantial pleiotropic properties as a neuroprotective agent in both animal models and humans.  RESULTS: There was a better recovery rate and GOS score for the patients who were given progesterone than for those in the control group in a 3-months follow-up period (50% vs.  21%); subgroup analysis showed a significant difference in the percentage of favorable outcome between the two groups with GCS of 5-8 (p=0. 03).  CONCLUSION: The use of progesterone may significantly improve neurologic outcome of patients suffering severe TBI up to 3 months after injury, especially those with 5≤GCS≤8, providing a potential benefit to the treatment of acute severe TBI patients.  Considering this drug had no significant side effects, so progesterone could be used in patients with severe TBI as a neuro-protective drug.  While progesterone and ciclosporin have shown promise in phase II studies, success in larger phase III, randomized, multicentre, clinical trials is pending.   All three studies reported the effects of progesterone on mortality.  The pooled risk ratio (RR) for mortality at end of follow-up was 0. 61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0. 40 to 0. 93.  Three studies measured disability and found the RR of death or severe disability in patients treated with progesterone to be 0. 77, 95% CI 0. 62 to 0. 96.  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Current clinical evidence from three small RCTs indicates progesterone may improve the neurologic outcome of patients suffering TBI.  This evidence is still insufficient and further multicentre randomised controlled trials are required.  GOS was classified to 2 main categories of favorable and unfavorable recovery, of which, favorable recovery in placebo, progesterone, and progesterone-vitamin D was 25%, 45%, and 60%, respectively which showed a statistical significant difference among the groups (P-value = 0. 03).  CONCLUSION: The results showed that recovery rate in patients with severe brain trauma in the group receiving progesterone and vitamin D together was significantly higher than that of progesterone group, which was in turn higher than that of placebo group.   The pooled relative risk (RR) for mortality at end of follow-up is 0. 61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0. 40 to 0. 93.  Three studies measured disability and found the RR of death or severe disability in patients treated with progesterone was 0. 77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0. 62 to 0. 96.  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Current clinical evidence from three small RCTs indicates progesterone may improve the neurologic outcome of patients suffering TBI.  This evidence is still insufficient and further multicentre randomised controlled trials are required.  Clinical trials have shown that short-and long-term progesterone treatment induces a significant improvement in the level of disability among patients with brain injury.   Improved outcomes from the administration of progesterone for patients with acute severe traumatic brain injury: a randomized controlled trial.  CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that acute severe TBI patients with administration of progesterone hold improved neurologic outcomes for up to 6 months.  These results provide information important for further large and multicenter clinical trials on progesterone as a promising neuroprotective drug.   The modified Functional Independence Measure scores in the progesterone group were higher than those in the placebo group at both 3-month and 6-month follow-up (P < 0. 05 and P < 0. 01).  The mortality rate of the progesterone group was significantly lower than that of the placebo group at 6-month follow-up (P < 0. 05).   CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that acute severe TBI patients with administration of progesterone hold improved neurologic outcomes for up to 6 months.  These results provide information important for further large and multicenter clinical trials on progesterone as a promising neuroprotective drug.   These data, combined with the results of the previously published ProTECT trial, show progesterone to be safe and potentially efficacious in the treatment of TBI.  Larger phase III trials will be necessary to verify results prior to clinical implementation.  CONCLUSION: It indicated that successive early application of PG will benefit the patients with acute severe head injury by improving the recovery and reducing the disability, which may be related to its alleviating inflammatory and lipid peroxidation response.  Adverse and serious adverse event rates were similar in both groups, except that patients randomized to progesterone had a lower 30-day mortality rate than controls (rate ratio 0. 43; 95% confidence interval 0. 18 to 0. 99).   However, moderate traumatic brain injury survivors who received progesterone were more likely to have a moderate to good outcome than those randomized to placebo.  CONCLUSION: In this small study, progesterone caused no discernible harm and showed possible signs of benefit.  After more than 30 years of research and 30 failed clinical trials with as many different treatments, progesterone is the first agent to demonstrate robust clinical efficacy as a treatment for traumatic brain injuries.

Laboratory data strongly show that progesterone treatment after TBI reduces edema, improves outcomes, and restores blood-brain barrier function.  Clinical studies to date agree with these data, and there are ongoing human trials for progesterone treatment after TBI.

"[SOC]###context: Deadenylation of eukaryotic mRNA is a mechanism critical for mRNA function by influencing mRNA turnover and efficiency of protein synthesis.  In short, PARN is a divalent metal-ion dependent poly(A)-specific, processive and cap-interacting 3'-5' exoribonuclease that efficiently degrades poly(A) tails of eukaryotic mRNAs.  Distinct roles of the R3H and RRM domains in poly(A)-specific ribonuclease structural integrity and catalysis.  Deadenylases specifically catalyze the degradation of eukaryotic mRNA poly(A) tail in the 3'- to 5'-end direction with the release of 5'-AMP as the product.  Among the deadenylase family, poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) is unique in its domain composition, which contains three potential RNA-binding domains: the catalytic nuclease domain, the R3H domain and the RRM domain.  miRNA-mediated deadenylation is orchestrated by GW182 through two conserved motifs that interact with CCR4-NOT.  The rate-limiting step of mRNA degradation is the removal of the poly(A) tail by deadenylases.  Purified PUM complexes were found to contain subunits of the CCR4-NOT (CNOT) complex, which contains multiple enzymes that catalyze mRNA deadenylation.  These findings demonstrate a conserved mechanism of PUF-mediated repression via direct recruitment of the CCR4-POP2-NOT deadenylase leading to translational inhibition and mRNA degradation.  The activity and selectivity of fission yeast Pop2p are affected by a high affinity for Zn2+ and Mn2+ in the active site.  In eukaryotic organisms, initiation of mRNA turnover is controlled by progressive shortening of the poly-A tail, a process involving the mega-Dalton Ccr4-Not complex and its two associated 3'-5' exonucleases, Ccr4p and Pop2p (Caf1p).  Here, we show biochemically and structurally that fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) Pop2p prefers Mn(2+) and Zn(2+) over Mg(2+) at the concentrations of the ions found inside cells and that the identity of the ions in the active site affects the activity of the enzyme.  The 3'-poly(A) tail, found on virtually all mRNAs, is enzymatically shortened by a process referred to as ""deadenylation. "" Deadenylation is a widespread means of controlling mRNA stability and translation.  Dynamic changes of the lengths of mRNA poly(A) tails are catalysed by diverse deadenylase enzymes.  In eukaryotes, shortening of the 3'-poly(A) tail is the rate-limiting step in the degradation of most mRNAs, and two major mRNA deadenylase complexes--Caf1-Ccr4 and Pan2-Pan3--play central roles in this process, referred to as deadenylation.  Previously, we demonstrated that eukaryotic releasing factor eRF3 mediates deadenylation and decay of mRNA in a manner coupled to translation termination.  PUF protein-mediated deadenylation is catalyzed by Ccr4p.  Deadenylation of mRNA is often the first and rate-limiting step in mRNA decay.  PARN, a poly(A)-specific 3' --> 5' ribonuclease which is conserved in many eukaryotes, has been proposed to be primarily responsible for such a reaction, yet the importance of the PARN function at the whole-organism level has not been demonstrated in any species.  The trypanosomal deadenylase activity is a 3'-->5' exonuclease specific for adenylate residues, generates 5'-AMP as a product, is magnesium dependent, and is inhibited by neomycin B sulfate.  Identification of multiple RNA features that influence CCR4 deadenylation activity.  The CCR4 family proteins are 3'-5'-deadenylases that function in the first step of the degradation of poly(A) mRNA.  PARN, Nocturnin and Angel are three of the multiple deadenylases that have been described in eukaryotic cells.  Thus, deadenylation and the participating deadenylases are not simply required for preparing mRNA substrates; they play an indispensable role both structurally and functionally in P-body formation and regulation.  In this context, the wide repertoire of RBPs and molecules that regulate PARN activity, together with the established role of deadenylases in miRNA-mediated regulation of mRNA expression, suggest that mRNA turnover is more complex than it was previously thought and PARN holds a key role in this process.  A set of multiple poly(A)-specific deadenylases has been identified, some, if not most, of which are likely to play a role in the key first step of mRNA turnover--the regulated shortening of the poly(A) tail. 
###question: What is the role of deadenylases in the cell?[EOC] [SOR]###response: The 3'-poly(A) tail, found on mRNAs, is enzymatically shortened by a process referred to as ""deadenylation"" which is carried out by deadenylases.

"[SOC]###context: Strikingly, in addition to ULK1 and ULK2, ATG13 and FIP200 interacted with human ATG8 proteins, all with strong preference for the GABARAP subfamily.  GABARAPL1 belongs to the small family of GABARAP proteins (including GABARAP, GABARAPL1 and GABARAPL2/GATE-16), one of the two subfamilies of the yeast Atg8 orthologue.  Identification of the Atg8 family interacting motif (AIM) in Stbd1 required for interaction with GABARAPL1 Stbd1 has been reported to interact with a known autophagy protein, GABARAPL1, a member of the Atg8 family.  Atg8 is a yeast protein involved in the autophagic process and in particular in the elongation of autophagosomes.  In mammals, several orthologs have been identified and are classed into two subfamilies: the LC3 subfamily and the GABARAP subfamily, referred to simply as the LC3 or GABARAP families.  GABARAPL1 (GABARAP-like protein 1), one of the proteins belonging to the GABARAP (GABA(A) receptor-associated protein) family The proteins that make up the GABARAP family demonstrate conservation of their amino acid sequences and protein structures.  In humans, GABARAPL1 shares 86% identity with GABARAP and 61% with GABARAPL2 (GATE-16).  The selectivity is mediated by autophagy receptors, such as p62 and NBR1, which can bind to autophagic effector proteins (Atg8 in yeast, MAP1LC3 protein family in mammals) anchored in the membrane of autophagosomes.  ATG3 is the E2-like enzyme necessary for ATG8/LC3 lipidation during autophagy.  Recently, autophagy receptors, like p62/SQSTM1 and NBR1, which physically link autophagic cargo to ATG8/MAP1-LC3/GABARAP family members located on the forming autophagic membranes, have been identified.  At least eight different Atg8 orthologs belonging to two subfamilies (LC3 and GATE-16/GABARAP) occur in mammalian cells, but their individual roles and modes of action are largely unknown.  truncated DeltaN63 Atg4D displays increased activity against the Atg8 paralogue, gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein-like 1 (GABARAP-L1) Structure of GATE-16, membrane transport modulator and mammalian ortholog of autophagocytosis factor Aut7p.  The yeast ortholog of GATE-16 is the autophagocytosis factor Aut7p.  GATE-16 is also closely related to the GABA receptor-associated protein (GABARAP), Three human Atg8 (hAtg8) homologs, LC3, GABARAP, and GATE-16, have been characterized as modifiers in reactions mediated by hAtg7 (an E1-like enzyme) and hAtg3 (an E2-like enzyme) as in yeast Atg8 lipidation, but their final targets have not been identified.

"[SOC]###context:  In Arabidopsis thaliana, LHP1 co-localizes with H3K27me3 epigenetic marks throughout the genome and interacts with PRC1 and PRC2 members as well as with a long noncoding RNA.   When cells enter senescence the binding to RD of both PRC1 and PRC2 complexes is lost leading to a decreased level of histone H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3).  PRC2 induces histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) trimethylation (H3K27me3), which is subsequently read by PRC1 that further catalyzes H2A monoubiquitination (H2Aub1), creating a transcriptional silent chromatin conformation.   Histone H2A monoubiquitination (H2Aub1), catalyzed by Polycomb-Repressive Complex1 (PRC1), is a key epigenetic mark in Polycomb silencing.  For a long time, the PcG mechanism has been proposed to follow a hierarchical recruitment of PcG repressive complexes (PRCs) to target genes in which the binding of PRC2 and the incorporation of H3 lysine 27 trimethyl marks led to recruitment of PRC1, which in turn mediated H2A monoubiquitination.  Histone H2A monoubiquitination (H2Aub1), catalyzed by Polycomb-Repressive Complex1 (PRC1), is a key epigenetic mark in Polycomb silencing.

We found that the antioxidant enzyme peroxiredoxin-2 (Prx2) inversely correlated with the metastatic capacity of human melanoma cells.  The aim of this study was to examine gonadotropin regulation of antioxidant enzyme sulfiredoxin (Srx) and peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2) expressions and modification during the ovulatory process in rats.   The mRNA profiler array showed more than 2-fold differential expression of 32 oxidative stress-related genes in unstimulated moDCs, including peroxiredoxin-2 (PRDX2), an enzyme reducing hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxides.   Peroxiredoxin-2 (Prx-2) is an abundant mammalian enzyme that protects against oxidative stress.  Peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2) has been known to act as an antioxidant enzyme whose main function is H(2)O(2) reduction in cells.   These data indicate that Srx1 activity protects mice from the lethality of endotoxic shock, adding this enzyme to other host factors, as NRF2 and peroxiredoxin 2, which by regulating cellular reactive oxygen species levels act as important modifiers in the pathogenesis of sepsis.  One of the identified proteins was peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2), an anti-oxidant enzyme.   Peroxiredoxin-2 (Prdx2), a potent peroxide reductant, is the third most abundant protein in the erythrocyte and might be expected to play a major role in the cell's oxidative defenses.   Importantly, we also demonstrate the antioxidant enzyme Prx2 (peroxiredoxin 2) as a critical cytoplasmic target of cdk5.   Human erythrocyte peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2) is a typical 2-cys cytosolic peroxiredoxin with thiol-dependent hydrogen peroxide scavenger activity.   Peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2) is an antioxidant enzyme that uses cysteine residues to decompose peroxides.  Peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2), an antioxidant enzyme, was the most upregulated while tribbles homolog 3 (TRB3), a pro-apoptotic protein, was the most downregulated, implying a beneficial effect of lithium on neuronal cells.  After 5 Gy irradiation, the relative abundance of peroxiredoxin 2, an antioxidant enzyme, and latexin, an inhibitor of carboxypeptidase, increased.   Peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2), a thiol-dependent peroxidase, is the third most abundant protein in the erythrocyte, and its absence in knock-out mice gives rise to hemolytic anemia.

In patients with a new DFU, we recommend probe to bone test and plain films to be followed by magnetic resonance imaging if a soft tissue abscess or osteomyelitis is suspected.   Diagnostic Accuracy of Probe to Bone to Detect Osteomyelitis in the Diabetic Foot: A Systematic Review.  The probe-to-bone (PTB) test is a commonly used clinical test for osteomyelitis (OM), but its utility has been questioned in clinical settings where the prevalence of OM is low.  This article aims to systematically review the accuracy of the PTB test to diagnose diabetic foot OM.  Pooled sensitivity and specificity for the PTB test was 0. 87 (95% confidence interval [CI], . 75-. 93) and 0. 83 (95% CI, . 65-. 93), respectively.  We conclude that the PTB test can accurately rule in diabetic foot OM in the high-risk patients and rule out OM in low-risk patients.  Inter-observer reproducibility of diagnosis of diabetic foot osteomyelitis based on a combination of probe-to-bone test and simple radiography.  Probe-to-bone test and simple X-rays are both standard tests for the diagnosis of diabetic foot osteomyelitis.  This study demonstrates the importance of considering jointly clinical information (probe-to-bone test) and diagnostic tests (simple radiography) to increase agreement among clinicians on diagnosis of diabetic foot osteomyelitis.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has a higher sensitivity and specificity (90% and 79%) than plain radiography (54% and 68%) for diagnosing diabetic foot osteomyelitis.  MRI performs somewhat better than any of several common tests--probe to bone (PTB), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)>70 mm/hr, C-reactive protein (CRP)>14 mg/L, procalcitonin>0. 3 ng/mL, and ulcer size>2 cm²--although PTB has the highest specificity of any test and is commonly used together with MRI.

The tool is based on an existing method for finding change points in time series data, but some filtration techniques are also adopted to remove change points that are likely false APA sites.  It is then extended to identify APA sites that are expressed differently between two biological samples and genes that contain 3' UTRs with shortening/lengthening events.

PlantAPA: A Portal for Visualization and Analysis of Alternative Polyadenylation in Plants.  Increasing numbers of poly(A) sites collected in various plant species demand new methods and tools to access and mine these data.  We have created an open-access web service called PlantAPA (http://bmi. xmu. edu. cn/plantapa) to visualize and analyze genome-wide poly(A) sites in plants.  PlantAPA provides various interactive and dynamic graphics and seamlessly integrates a genome browser that can profile heterogeneous cleavage sites and quantify expression patterns of poly(A) sites across different conditions.  Particularly, through PlantAPA, users can analyze poly(A) sites in extended 3' UTR regions, intergenic regions, and ambiguous regions owing to alternative transcription or RNA processing.  In addition, it also provides tools for analyzing poly(A) site selections, 3' UTR lengthening or shortening, non-canonical APA site switching, and differential gene expression between conditions, making it more powerful for the study of APA-mediated gene expression regulation.  More importantly, PlantAPA offers a bioinformatics pipeline that allows users to upload their own short reads or ESTs for poly(A) site extraction, enabling users to further explore poly(A) site selection using stored PlantAPA poly(A) sites together with their own poly(A) site datasets.

As a user-friendly web service, PlantAPA will be a valuable addition to the community of biologists studying APA mechanisms and gene expression regulation in plants.  In our recent RNA-seq experiments using cells with hyper-activated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), we found that cellular mTOR activation leads to transcriptome-wide alternative polyadenylation (APA), resulting in the activation of multiple cellular pathways.  Here, we developed a novel bioinformatics algorithm, IntMAP, which integrates RNA-Seq and PolyA Site (PAS)-Seq data for a comprehensive characterization of APA events.  By applying IntMAP to the datasets from cells with hyper-activated mTOR, we identified novel APA events that could otherwise not be identified by either profiling method alone.  Several transcription factors including Cebpg (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein gamma) were among the newly discovered APA transcripts, indicating that diverse transcriptional networks may be regulated by mTOR-coordinated APA.  The prevention of APA in Cebpg using the CRISPR/cas9-mediated genome editing tool showed that mTOR-driven 3'-UTR shortening in Cebpg is critical in protecting cells from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.  Taken together, we present IntMAP as a new bioinformatics algorithm for APA analysis by which we expand our understanding of the physiological role of mTOR-coordinated APA events to ER stress response.

"[SOC]###context:  The loss of CD55 and CD59 renders PNH erythrocytes susceptible to intravascular haemolysis, which can lead to thrombosis and to much of the morbidity and mortality of PNH.   CD55 Deficiency, Early-Onset Protein-Losing Enteropathy, and Thrombosis.  CONCLUSIONS: CD55 deficiency with hyperactivation of complement, angiopathic thrombosis, and protein-losing enteropathy (the CHAPLE syndrome) is caused by abnormal complement activation due to biallelic loss-of-function mutations in CD55.   It is caused by the expansion of a hematopoietic progenitor cell that has acquired a mutation in the X-linked phosphatidylinositol glycan class A (PIGA) gene that results in deficiency of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor structure responsible for fixing a wide spectrum of proteins particularly CD55 and CD59.  The clinical features of this disease arise as a result of complement-mediated hemolysis in unprotected red cells, leukocytes, and platelets as well as the release of free hemoglobin.  Patients may present with a variety of clinical manifestations, such as anemia, thrombosis, kidney disease, smooth muscle dystonias, abdominal pain, dyspnea, and extreme fatigue.  The lack of one of the GPI-AP complement regulatory proteins (CD55, CD59) leads to hemolysis.  The disease is diagnosed with hemolytic anemia, marrow failure and thrombosis.  Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare bone marrow failure disorder that manifests with hemolytic anemia, thrombosis, and peripheral blood cytopenias.  The absence of two glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, CD55 and CD59, leads to uncontrolled complement activation that accounts for hemolysis and other PNH manifestations.  RESULTS: CD55 and/or CD59 deficiencies were found in 1. 6% (2/127) of patients with primary BCS, 1. 0% (1/100) of non-malignant and non-cirrhotic patients with PVT, and 4. 7% (4/85) of cirrhotic patients with PVT.  Data of this study indicate that the PNH defect as detected with CD55, CD59, and CD16 is not an important cause of intra-abdominal thrombosis in northwestern India.  PNH testing of red blood cells revealed a CD55 and CD59 deficiency consistent with PNH in both cases.  The systemic complications typically associated with thrombosis were not observed for the following several months with early conservative treatments including eculizumab.  Deficiency of the GPI-anchored complement inhibitors CD55 and CD59 on erythrocytes leads to intravascular hemolysis upon complement activation.  Apart from hemolysis, another prominent feature is a highly increased risk of thrombosis.  Genetic reconstitution of CD55 or treatment with a complement-inhibitory therapeutic antibody reversed abnormal complement activation. <br><b>CONCLUSIONS</b>: CD55 deficiency with hyperactivation of complement, angiopathic thrombosis, and protein-losing enteropathy (the CHAPLE syndrome) is caused by abnormal complement activation due to biallelic loss-of-function mutations in CD55.  Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired clonal disorder characterized by a decrease or absence of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored molecules such as CD55 and CD59 from the surface of affected cells, resulting in intravascular hemolysis, cytopenia, and venous thrombosis.  CONCLUSIONS CD55 deficiency with hyperactivation of complement, angiopathic thrombosis, and protein-losing enteropathy (the CHAPLE syndrome) is caused by abnormal complement activation due to biallelic loss-of-function mutations in CD55.

"[SOC]###context:  In addition, IL-6 concentrations affect clinical outcomes in ischemic stroke.  After appropriate adjustment, the odds ratios for the association of markers and poor outcome (comparing the upper and the lower third) were interleukin-6, 3. 1 (95% CI: 1. 9-5. 0); C-reactive protein, 1. 9 (95% CI: 1. 2-3. 1); fibrinogen, 1. 5 (95% CI: 1. 0-2. 36); white cell count, 2. 1 (95% CI: 1. 3-3. 4); and glucose 1. 3 (95% CI: 0. 8-2. 1).  The results for interleukin-6 were similar to other studies.   -6 and IL-10 levels were higher in patients with poor outcome.  On logistic regression analysis, higher values of IL-6 were significantly associated with clinical outcome at 1 month (odds ratio [OR], 1. 25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1. 02-1. 54).   In hemorrhagic stroke, high levels of IL-6 in the early phase indicated a poor neurological outcome.  Initially elevated levels of hs-IL-6 at presentation further correlated with unfavorable clinical outcomes (by NIHSS and mRs) at both time points.  Analysis of variance in the different quartiles identified an hs-IL-6 gradient-dependent correlation at both time points, such that the higher the initial hs-IL-6 concentration, the higher the elevation in inflammatory biomarkers and the poorer the neurological state at both time points (p<0. 001 for NIHSS and p=0. 001 for mRs, for trend across quartiles).  CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the potential of employing hs-IL-6 as an early stage biomarker for the prognosis of acute ischemic stroke.   Another negative correlation was found between IL-6 and CNS scores (r = -0. 451, p = 0. 000).  In addition, increased levels of IL-6 and reduced levels of protein C and protein S may play a role in acute ischemic stroke severity.  Variables that are predictors of adverse stroke outcome include erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and intercellular adhesion molecule-1.

Chronic Spinal Subdural Hematoma Associated with Antiplatelet Therapy.  pinal subdural hematoma associated with antiplatelet therapy The authors report a case of acute spinal epidural hematoma occurring in a patient receiving antiplatelet drugs.   Spontaneous epidural hematoma of the spine (SEHS) is an extremely rare entity.  Patients known to have thrombophilia or on anticoagulant drugs are the most affected Most cases of spinal hematoma have a multifactorial etiology whose individual components are not all understood in detail.  In up to a third of cases (29. 7%) of spinal hematoma, no etiological factor can be identified as the cause of the bleeding.  Following idiopathic spinal hematoma, cases related to anticoagulant therapy and vascular malformations represent the second and third most common categories.  Spinal and epidural anesthetic procedures in combination with anticoagulant therapy represent the fifth most common etiological group and spinal and epidural anesthetic procedures alone represent the tenth most common cause of spinal hematoma.  Anticoagulant therapy alone probably does not trigger spinal hemorrhage.  We report the case of a man of 65 who, at 20 and 37 days from surgery of C6 corpectomy, experienced two epidural hematomas at C7-D1.  We assume that the pathogenic cause of this rare disease was an overlap between three main factors: the surgical aggression of the internal anterior epidural venous plexus; a possible increase of intra-thoracic pressure due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and double antiplatelet drug therapy.

However, very few E3 ubiquitin ligases are known to target G-CSFR for ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.  Here we identified F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (Fbw7), a substrate recognizing component of Skp-Cullin-F box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin Ligase physically associates with G-CSFR and promotes its ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation.  FBW7 is a crucial component of an SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, which mediates degradation of an array of different target proteins.  F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (FBW7), the substrate-binding subunit of E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF(FBW7) (a complex of SKP1, cullin-1 and FBW7), plays important roles in various physiological and pathological processes.  The tumor suppressor Fbxw7 (also known as Sel-10, hCdc4, hAgo, or Fbw7) is an F-box protein that functions as the substrate-recognition subunit of an SCF ubiquitin ligase complex and targets a group of oncoproteins for degradation.   Fbw7 is the substrate recognition component of the Skp1-Cullin-F-box (SCF)-type E3 ligase complex and a well-characterized tumor suppressor that targets numerous oncoproteins for destruction.  Fbw7 is a member of F-box family proteins, which constitute one subunit of Skp1, Cul1, and F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex.  The F-box protein Fbw7 (also known as Fbxw7, hCdc4 and Sel-10) functions as a substrate recognition component of a SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase.  SCF(Fbw7) facilitates polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of various proteins such as Notch, cyclin E, c-Myc and c-Jun.

The Fbxw7 (F-box/WD repeat-containing protein 7; also called CDC4, Sel10, Ago, and Fbw7) component of the SCF (Skp1/Cullin/F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex acts as a tumor suppressor in several tissues and targets multiple transcriptional activators and protooncogenes for ubiquitin-mediated degradation.  The F-box protein Fbw7 (also known as Fbxw7, hCdc4 and Sel-10) functions as a substrate recognition component of a SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase.  We demonstrate here that Fbw7 (F-box and WD repeat domain containing-7), the substrate recognition component of an SCF (complex of SKP1, CUL1 and F-box protein)-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, is a key regulator of NSC/NPC viability and differentiation.  The SCF(Fbw7) ubiquitin ligase complex plays important roles in cell growth, survival, and differentiation via the ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated regulation of protein stability.  F-box and WD-40 domain protein 7 (Fbw7) provides substrate specificity for the Skp1-Cullin1-F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex that targets multiple oncoproteins for degradation, including cyclin E, c-Myc, c-Jun, Notch, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).  Mammalian Fbw7 (also known as Sel-10, hCdc4, or hAgo) is the F-box protein component of an SCF (Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein-Rbx1)-type ubiquitin ligase, and the mouse Fbw7 is expressed prominently in the endothelial cell lineage of embryos.

However, their wide distribution and ubiquitous nature signifies their fundamental importance in plant survival.  Cyclophilins (Cyps) are ubiquitous proteins that effect the cis-trans isomerization of Pro amide bonds, and are thus crucial to protein folding.  FK506 binding proteins (FKBPs) and cyclophilins (CYPs) are abundant and ubiquitous proteins belonging to the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) superfamily, which regulate much of metabolism through a chaperone or an isomerization of proline residues during protein folding.  Cyclophilin is a ubiquitous peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase that plays critical roles in many biological processes.  The receptor for cyclosporin is the protein cyclophilin, which is a ubiquitous peptidylprolyl isomerase.   Cyps (cyclophilins) are ubiquitous proteins of the immunophilin superfamily with proposed functions in protein folding, protein degradation, stress response and signal transduction.   Cyclophilins are folding helper enzymes belonging to the class of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases; EC 5. 2. 1. 8) that catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of peptidyl-prolyl bonds in proteins.  They are ubiquitous proteins present in almost all living organisms analyzed to date, with extremely rare exceptions.  Immunophilins are ubiquitous enzymes responsible for proline isomerisation during protein synthesis and for the chaperoning of several membrane proteins.  Cyclophilins (CyPs) are a large class of highly conserved ubiquitous peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases.  Cyclophilins belong to the family of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases (PPIases), which are ubiquitous and highly conserved enzymes capable of cis/trans isomerizing Xaa-Pro peptide bonds.   Originally identified as the cellular targets of immunosuppressant drugs, the immunophilins encompass two ubiquitous protein families: the FK-506 binding proteins or FKBPs, and the cyclosporin-binding proteins or cyclophilins.

"[SOC]###context: The meta-analyses yielded significantly increased risks for all CNS tumors, glioma and meningioma in users of estrogen-only [1. 35 (1. 22-1. 49), 1. 23 (1. 06-1. 42) and 1. 31 (1. 20-1. 43), respectively] but not estrogen-progestin HT [1. 09 (0. 99-1. 19), 0. 92 (0. 78-1. 08) and 1. 05 (0. 95-1. 16), respectively]; these differences were statistically significant (p<0. 005 for each tumor type).  There was no significant difference between glioma and meningioma risk in users of estrogen-only HT.  The totality of the available evidence suggests an increased risk of all CNS tumors (and of glioma and meningioma separately) in users of estrogen-only HT.   Among premenopausal women, current use of oral contraceptives was associated with an increased risk of meningiomas (OR 1. 8, 95% CI 1. 1-2. 9), while current use of hormone replacement therapy among postmenopausal women was not associated with a significant elevation in risk (OR 1. 1, 95% CI 0. 74-1. 67).   The relationship between current use of exogenous hormones and meningioma remains unclear, limited by the small numbers of patients currently on oral hormone medications and a lack of hormone receptor data for meningioma tumors.  Ever use of estradiol-only therapy was associated with an increased risk of meningioma (standardized incidence ratio = 1. 29, 95% confidence interval: 1. 15, 1. 44).  Among women who had been using estradiol-only therapy for at least 3 years, the incidence of meningioma was 1. 40-fold higher (95% confidence interval: 1. 18, 1. 64; P<0. 001) than in the background population.   Estradiol-only therapy was accompanied with a slightly increased risk of meningioma.  Results from several prospective, large-scale studies indicate that postmenopausal hormone therapy may increase the risk for diagnosing meningioma by 30-80%, but there is no effect in regard to glioma.   A retrospective study including more than 350,000 women, about 1400 of whom had developed meningioma, showed that the risk of meningioma was about twice as high in users of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy as in non-users.  Compared with never users of HRT, the relative risks (RRs) for all incident CNS tumours, gliomas, meningiomas and acoustic neuromas in current users of HRT were 1. 20 (95% CI: 1. 05-1. 36), 1. 09 (95% CI: 0. 89-1. 32), 1. 34 (95% CI: 1. 03-1. 75) and 1. 58 (95% CI: 1. 02-2. 45), respectively, and there was no significant difference in the relative risks by tumour type (heterogeneity p = 0. 2).   BACKGROUND: Previous studies on association of exogenous female sex hormones and risk for meningioma have yielded conflicting results.  RESULTS: Postmenopausal hormonal treatment, use of contraceptives, or fertility treatment did not influence the risk of meningioma.   CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found little indication that reproductive factors or use of exogenous sex hormones affect meningioma risk.  Although not definitive, available data suggest an association between the use of hormone replacement therapy and increased meningioma risk.   BACKGROUND: The role of exogenous hormone exposures in the development of meningioma is unclear, but these exposures have been proposed as one hypothesis to explain the over-abundance of such tumors in women.  RESULTS: Although risk of meningioma appeared modestly elevated in past OC users (OR = 1. 5, 95% CI 0. 8 - 2. 7), and in current users (OR = 2. 5, 95% CI 0. 5 - 12. 6), the confidence intervals were wide.   Likewise, risk of meningioma was only weakly associated with past use of HRT (OR = 0. 7, 95% CI 0. 4 - 1. 3), and not at all with current use of HRT (OR = 1. 0, 95% CI 0. 5 - 2. 2).    Overall, in post menopausal women, HRT use appeared to confer a non-significant protective effect, and was not associated with low or high PR expressing meningiomas. CONCLUSION: This study found little evidence of associations between meningioma and exogenous hormone exposures in women but did suggest that some hormonal exposures may influence tumor biology in those women who develop meningioma.  The increased odds ratios with African Americans was retained in post-menopausal women, while the protective odds ratios for pregnancy, smoking and oral contraceptives (OCs) became stronger in pre-menopausal women.  The pattern by duration and timing of use does not suggest an etiologic role for OCs or hormone replacement therapy.   The use of hormone replacement therapy in symptomatic postmenopausal women either with previously treated disease or with dormant tumors is discussed, but remains controversial.  Although not definitive, available data suggest an association between the use of hormone replacement therapy and increased meningioma risk.  OC use was associated with increased risk of a meningioma expressing less rather than more PR (OR = 3. 2, 95% CI 1. 3 - 8. 0).   In further analysis by hormone receptor status, there was some indication for an increased risk of progesterone receptor-positive meningiomas associated with oral contraceptive use (OR 1. 39, 95% confidence interval 0. 92-2. 10) and other hormonal contraception (OR 1. 50, 95% CI 0. 95-2. 36).   Several studies indicate that use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is associated with an increased risk of intracranial meningioma, while associations between HRT use and risk of other brain tumors have been less explored.  available data suggest an association between the use of hormone replacement therapy and increased meningioma risk.  A significant positive association existed between meningioma risk and increased body mass index (p &lt; 0. 01) while a significant negative association existed between meningioma risk and current smoking (p &lt; 0. 01).  Among premenopausal women, current use of oral contraceptives was associated with an increased risk of meningiomas (OR 1. 8, 95% CI 1. 1-2. 9), while current use of hormone replacement therapy among postmenopausal women was not associated with a significant elevation in risk (OR 1. 1, 95% CI 0. 74-1. 67).  A higher risk of meningioma was observed among postmenopausal women who were current users of hormone replacement therapy (HR, Among premenopausal women, current use of oral contraceptives was associated with an increased risk of meningiomas (OR 1. 8, 95% CI 1. 1-2. 9), while current use of hormone replacement therapy among postmenopausal women was not associated with a significant elevation in risk (OR 1. 1, 95% CI 0. 74-1. 67).  There was no association between use of fertility medications and meningioma risk.  Although not definitive, available data suggest an association between the use of hormone replacement therapy and increased meningioma risk.  A higher risk of meningioma was observed among postmenopausal women who were current users of hormone replacement therapy (HR, 1. 79; 95% CI, 1. 18-2. 71) compared with never users.

"[SOC]###context: Mutagenesis and homologous recombination in Drosophila cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9.  We have applied the CRISPR/Cas9 system to Drosophila S2 cells to generate targeted genetic mutations in more than 85% of alleles.  By targeting a constitutive exon of the AGO1 gene, we demonstrate homozygous mutation in up to 82% of cells, thereby allowing the study of genetic knockouts in a Drosophila cell line for the first time.  We have shown that homologous gene targeting is possible at 1-4% efficiency using this system, allowing for the construction of defined insertions and deletions.  This technology enables controlled genetic manipulation in Drosophila cell lines, and its simplicity offers the opportunity to study cellular phenotypes genome-wide.  The prokaryotic CRISPR/Cas9 type II genome editing system has recently been applied in cell lines and vertebrates.  We now demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis in zebrafish is highly efficient, reaching up to 86. 0%, and is heritable.  The efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9 system further facilitated the targeted knock-in of a protein tag provided by a donor oligonucleotide with knock-in efficiencies of 3. 5-15. 6%.   The ease and efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9 system with limited off-target effects make it a powerful genome engineering tool for in vivo studies.  Cas9/CRISPR has been reported to efficiently induce targeted gene disruption and homologous recombination in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.  Sequence-specific nucleases like TALENs and the CRISPR/Cas9 system have greatly expanded the genome editing possibilities in model organisms such as zebrafish.  Both systems have recently been used to create knock-out alleles with great efficiency, and TALENs have also been successfully employed in knock-in of DNA cassettes at defined loci via homologous recombination (HR).  Here we report CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in of DNA cassettes into the zebrafish genome at a very high rate by homology-independent double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways.

The CRISPR/Cas9 system has attracted significant attention for its potential to transform genome engineering.  We and others have recently shown that the RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease can be employed to engineer the Drosophila genome, and that these modifications are efficiently transmitted through the germline.

"[SOC]###context: This study aims to investigate whether an association exists between the ficolins that are part of the lectin complement pathway and SLE.   Ficolin-3 (also called H-ficolin or Hakata antigen) is a complement-activating pattern recognition molecule, possessing a fibrinogen-like domain involved in carbohydrate binding.   Lectin pathway activity via Ficolin-3 was measured in ELISA on acetylated bovine serum albumin (acBSA) and measured as Ficolin-3 binding and deposition of C4, C3 and the terminal complement complex (TCC).  Furthermore, Ficolin-3 mediated complement activation may be valuable in monitoring disease activity in SLE patients due to the high sensitivity for complement consumption in the assay independent of the Ficolin-3 concentration.  OBJECTIVES: To assess the involvement of ficolin-3, the main initiator of the lectin complement pathway (LCP), in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) pathology and outcome.  CONCLUSION: Our data provide evidence that LCP is activated after SAH and that the actual plasma concentrations of ficolin-3 reflect the severity of brain injury as evaluated by clinical and structural parameters.  These results support the idea that ficolin-3-mediated functional LCP activity may be targeted to control injury progression in SAH.  Ficolin-3-mediated lectin complement pathway activation in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage.  MBL-associated serine protease-3 circulates in high serum concentrations predominantly in complex with Ficolin-3 and regulates Ficolin-3 mediated complement activation.  Moreover, Ficolin-3 has a high complement activating potential and is the only collagenase proteolytic resistant molecule among the lectin complement pathway initiators.  Moreover, Ficolin-3 is the primary acceptor molecule of MASP-3 among the LCP activator molecules, but MASP-3 appears to down-regulate Ficolin-3 mediated complement activation through the lectin pathway.  Ficolin-3 (Hakata antigen or H-ficolin) is a soluble pattern recognition molecule in the lectin complement pathway.  Ficolin-3, encoded by the FCN3 gene and expressed in the lung and liver, is a recognition molecule in the lectin pathway of the complement system.  Ficolin-1, -2 and -3 are recognition molecules in the lectin complement pathway and form complexes with serine proteases named MASP-1, -2 and -3 and two nonenzymatic proteins.  MASP-2 is the main initiator of lectin pathway activation, while ficolin-3 is the most abundant ficolin molecule in the circulation.  Ficolin-3 (also called H-ficolin or Hakata antigen) is a complement-activating pattern recognition molecule, possessing a fibrinogen-like domain involved in carbohydrate binding.  Amongst human ficolins, Ficolin-3 has the highest concentration in serum and is the most potent lectin pathway activator in vitro.  Moreover, Ficolin-3 is the primary acceptor molecule of MASP-3 among the LCP activator molecules, but MASP-3 appears to down-regulate Ficolin-3 mediated complement activation through the lectin pathway.  Moreover, these LPS/ficolin-3 complexes activated the lectin pathway of complement in a C4b-deposition assay in a calcium- and magnesium-dependent way.

"[SOC]###context: Usual clinical concentrations of curare cause competitive inhibition of muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptors while higher concentrations may induce open channel blockade.  nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR)-blocking agents [e. g. , curare or alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-BTX) The short neurotoxins to which erabutoxins belong act by blocking the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor Both EFS- and carbachol-evoked contractions of the UES were blocked by curare at a lower concentration than by atropine or hexamethonium, suggesting that the acetylcholine receptor is nicotinic.  We applied ACh alone; the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist curare, either alone or in the presence of ACh; and the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) antagonist atropine, either alone or in the presence of ACh.  The EFS-induced contraction of the UES was completely blocked by tetrodotoxin and curare, and abolished in Ca2+ -free Ringer solution.  Curare binding and the curare-induced subconductance state of the acetylcholine receptor channel.  We have further investigated this particular mutation by examining the interaction of the competitive antagonist d-tubocurarine (curare) with the receptor.  d-Tubocurarine (curare) is a well-characterized competitive antagonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), and it is usually assumed that curare and agonists share a common binding site.  Curare action on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors has a number of facets, of which the best known is competitive antagonism.  The mode of action of curare, a well-known competitive antagonist of acetylcholine at the nicotinic receptor, was examined with the single channel recording technique.   ently, however, it has been shown that curare can also block the channels opened by ACh at the frog neuromuscular junction as well as on rat and Aplysia neurones; moreover, curare is able to depolarize rat myotubes and thus behaves as an agonist for the cholinergic receptor of this preparation (see ref.  6).  U One site, competitively blocked by bungarotoxin and by curare, is presumably the acetylcholine receptor.  In neuromuscular junction (NMJ) preparations, movements of the muscle must be inhibited if imaging during stimulation is desired (e. g. , by application of curare, a potent acetylcholine receptor inhibitor).  Curare has long been regarded as a typical competitive antagonist of acetylcholine (ACh) at the vertebrate neuromuscular junction.  Curare inhibition of wild-type receptors is consistent with curare binding to a single high-affinity binding site [inhibitor constant (Ki) = 20 nM].  Phenylalanine substitution for alpha Y198 [alpha Y198F (notation used here: subunit/amino acid in wild-type/residue number/substitution)] causes a 10-fold increase in curare affinity (Ki = 3. 1 nM), and measurement of the recovery from curare inhibition indicates that this increase in affinity is due to a reduction in the rate of curare dissociation from the receptor.  rthermore, sudden increases of research activity are ascribable to historic events, like the first use of curare as muscle relaxant during surgery. DIS Recently, however, it has been shown that curare can also block the channels opened by ACh at the frog neuromuscular junction as well as on rat and Aplysia neurones; moreover, curare is able to depolarize rat myotubes and thus behaves as an agonist for the cholinergic receptor of this preparation (see ref.  In Aplysia nervous tissue, curare appears not to be a specific antagonist for the nicotinic ACh receptor, but rather to be a specific blocking agent for a class of receptor-activated Na+ and Cl- responses.  The mode of action of curare, a well-known competitive antagonist of acetylcholine at the nicotinic receptor, was examined with the single channel recording technique.

PURPOSE: Trifluridine/tipiracil (FTD/TPI; TAS-102, Lonsurf®), a novel form of chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), has shown clinical benefit in the global, phase III RECOURSE trial, regardless of patient age.   BACKGROUND: Trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS-102, Lonsurf®), a novel oral anti-tumor agent combining an anti-neoplastic thymidine-based nucleoside analogue (trifluridine, FTD) with a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor (tipiracil hydrochloride, TPI) presents a new treatment option for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients refractory or intolerant to standard therapies.

"[SOC]###context: Super-enhancers are transcriptionally more active and cell type-specific than stretch enhancers.  We found that stretch enhancers are more abundant, more distal to transcription start sites, cover twice as much the genome, and are significantly less conserved than super-enhancers.  In contrast, super-enhancers are significantly more enriched for active chromatin marks and cohesin complex, and more transcriptionally active than stretch enhancers.  Importantly, a vast majority of super-enhancers (85%) overlap with only a small subset of stretch enhancers (13%), which are enriched for cell type-specific biological functions, and control cell identity genes.  These results suggest that super-enhancers are transcriptionally more active and cell type-specific than stretch enhancers, and importantly, most of the stretch enhancers that are distinct from super-enhancers do not show an association with cell identity genes, are less active, and more likely to be poised enhancers.

"[SOC]###context: Several nucleosome-protected sites in a region of the DHBV genome [nucleotides (nt) 2000 to 2700], known to harbor various cis transcription regulatory elements, were consistently identified in all DHBV-positive liver samples.  In addition, we observed other nucleosome protection sites in DHBV minichromosomes that may vary among individual ducks, but the pattern of MNase mapping in those regions is transmittable from the adult ducks to the newly infected ducklings.  nucleosomes along viral cccDNA in the minichromosomes are not random but sequence-specifically positioned.  Investigators studying the structure and function of hepadnaviral CCC DNA (3) have provided evidence that suggests that this structure exists in the nucleus of infected hepatocytes as a heterogeneous population of viral minichromosomes, which range from half to fully chromatinized, thought to be owing to their association with variable numbers of nucleosomes.  Characterization of nucleosome positioning in hepadnaviral covalently closed circular DNA minichromosomes.  To obtain insight on the structure of hepadnaviral cccDNA minichromosomes, we utilized ducks infected with the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) as a model and determined the in vivo nucleosome distribution pattern on viral cccDNA by the micrococcal nuclease (MNase) mapping and genome-wide PCR amplification of isolated mononucleosomal DHBV DNA.  Mature SV40 minichromosomes are estimated to contain about 27 nucleosomes (error +/- 2), except for those molecules with a nucleosome-free gap, which are interpreted to contain 25 nucleosomes (error +/- 2).  In vitro replication in the presence of protein-free competitor DNA shows that replicating trypsinized minichromosomes do not lose nucleosomes and replicating competitor DNA does not gain nucleosomes.  In vitro replication in the presence of protein-free competitor DNA shows that replicating trypsinized minichromosomes do not lose nucleosomes and replicating competitor DNA does not gain nucleosomes.  We conclude that in both cases parental nucleosomes are transferred to progeny DNA, and, in addition, that an assembly of new nucleosomes occurs during the replication of native minichromosomes.  In contrast, the replicated untreated minichromosomes were found to be densely packed with nucleosomes, indicating that an assembly of new nucleosomes occurred during in vitro replication.

"[SOC]###context: However, several issues in the processing and analysis of ChIP-chip data have not been resolved fully, including the effect of background (mock control) subtraction and normalization within and across arrays  Proper normalization is essential for ChIP-chip experiments.  The proposed normalization technique can correct systematic errors and compensate for the lack of mock control data, thus reducing the experimental cost and producing more accurate results.  Subtraction of the mock (non-specific antibody or no antibody) control data is generally needed to eliminate the bias, but appropriate normalization obviates the need for mock experiments and increases the correlation among replicates The proposed method can handle several control samples allowing for correction of multiple sources of bias simultaneously However, the data generated will always contain noise due to e. g.  repetitive regions or non-specific antibody interactions The generation of high copy numbers of DNA fragments as an artifact of the PCR step in ChIP-seq is an important source of bias of this methodology Here we describe several technical aspects of the ChIP-Seq assay that diminish bias and background noise and allow the consistent generation of high-quality data  This theoretical paper systematically characterizes the biases and properties of ChIP-seq data by comparing 62 separate publicly available datasets, using rigorous statistical models and signal processing techniques We detected a chromatin-state bias: open chromatin regions yielded higher coverage, which led to false positives if not corrected This bias had a greater effect on detection specificity than any base-composition bias This problem turns out to be surprisingly difficult, even in simple pairwise comparisons, because of the significant level of noise in ChIP-seq data We show that the ChIPnorm method removes most of the noise and bias in the data and outperforms other normalization methods We investigated the impact of library amplification bias on the identification of allele-specific (AS) molecular events from high-throughput sequencing data derived from chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP-seq) The 238 loci, termed ""hyper-ChIPable"", were in highly expressed regions with strong polymerase II and polymerase III enrichment signals, and the correlation between transcription level and ChIP enrichment was not limited to these 238 loci but extended genome-wide The localization of unrelated proteins, including the entire silencing complex, to the most highly transcribed genes was highly suggestive of a technical issue with the immunoprecipitations

"[SOC]###context: Mindfulness-based stress reduction appears to be a treatment worthy of further study, as in the short term, it is as effective as historical studies of drug treatment and bladder training in reducing urge incontinence and incontinence-related quality of life.  All patients, irrespective of the results of cystometry were subsequently treated with oxybutynin 2. 5 mg twice daily along with bladder training.  Of the 29 patients with stable bladder and symptoms of OAB, 100% cure rate was achieved in 20 (68. 9%) and 06 (20. 6%) patients respectively.  While in 3 patients in both groups, decrease of symptoms upto 75% after 6 months of treatment was observed.  Both urodynamically proven unstable and stable bladder showed nearly equal improvement with treatment There are 3 types of urine incontinence (urge-, stress-, and overflow-incontinence).  Another standardization of urinary incontinence follows dysfunctions of the pelvic floor: detrusor muscle-dependent, due to sphincter spasm, prostate gland dependent.  Urge incontinence with a dysfunction of the detrusor muscle is the most common type.  Mixed types are frequent.  Non-drug measures (e. g.  pelvic muscle training, bladder training, toilet training are first choice treatments.  Treatment of stress, urge and mixed incontinence can usually be commenced in primary care; pelvic floor exercises and bladder training are preferred.  If bladder training is not effective for urge incontinence, anticholinergic drugs should be considered.  Sixty patients (age 8 to 12 years) with urge incontinence or dysfunctional voiding were evaluated.  After a no-treatment control period (average 6 months), patients underwent a 6-day bladder training course Six months after training completion, 64. 1% and 64. 7% of the inpatient and outpatient groups with daytime wetting and 51. 5% and 17. 7% of the inpatient and outpatient groups with nighttime wetting were cured or had improved Of the inpatient group with urge incontinence, the functional bladder capacity increased by 15%.  To compare the efficacy of tolterodine plus simplified bladder training (BT) with tolterodine alone in patients with an overactive bladder.  CONCLUSIONS: Tolterodine 2 mg twice daily is an effective and well tolerated treatment for an overactive bladder, the effectiveness of which can be augmented by a simplified BT regimen.  Bladder training is a modification of bladder drill that is conducted more gradually on an outpatient basis and has resulted in significant reduction of incontinence in older, community-dwelling women.  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term effect of treatment of female incontinence by the general practitioner (pelvic floor exercises, and bladder training) in female urinary incontinence.  Stress incontinence and urge incontinence were treated by means of pelvic floor exercises and bladder training respectively, while a mixed incontinence was treated by bladder training followed by pelvic floor exercises.  T The treatment consisted of training of pelvic muscles in stress incontinence and bladder training in urge incontinence RESULTS: After 3 months the mean frequency of urine loss per week diminished from 21 to 8, and after 12 months to 6 times.  Some elders suffering from urge incontinence prefer pelvic muscle exercises to bladder training as the behavioral intervention of choice for eight out of nine women their continence had improved, both subjectively and objectively.  Bladder training is a simple, safe, and effective treatment in the management of mild to moderate forms of urinary incontinence in outpatient populations.  It can be used as a first-line treatment or in combination with such other interventions as pelvic muscle exercises, bladder pressure biofeedback, electrical stimulation, and drug therapy Treatment consisted of pelvic floor exercises in the case of stress incontinence and bladder training in the case of urge incontinence.  After 3 months about 60% of the patients were either dry or only mildly incontinent terodiline group shows this drug to be a valuable adjunct to a bladder regimen in children with urge incontinence Basing on our experience with 39 patients with severe urge incontinence (in one-quarter of the cases pure urge incontinence, in one-half of the cases mixed incontinence and in a further quarter of the cases neurogenic bladder disorders) a supervised programme (mictiogram) and a well-tried therapy (especially in the Anglo-Saxon countries) consisting of the triad hospitalisation/bladder training/medication therapy are presented.  After an average hospitalisation period of 14 days, we were able to achieve a symptom-free state in 94% of the patients.  Anamnestic and urodynamical results are evaluated before and after bladder retraining drill (BRD) in women suffering from urge incontinence.  We could state that the BRD is a good possibility to realize multistep-therapy of female incontinence.  Twenty consecutive female patients with urge incontinence and stable detrusor function on provocative rapid fill CO2-cystometry were treated as out-patients with a bladder training programme and with terodiline/placebo in a double-blind cross-over design.  In conclusion, female patients with idiopathic urge incontinence and stable detrusor function did respond to treatment as do female patients with urge incontinence and proven instability.  The results of in-patient bladder training in 65 women with frequency, urgency and urge incontinence are reported.  There was a good initial response in 88%.  By 6 months the response rate had fallen to 38%.  Patients with sensory urgency appeared to do better than those with detrusor instability and it is suggested that bladder training may be indicated as primary treatment in sensory urgency.  Bladder training and/or biofeedback techniques were used to treat 75 patients with frequency, urgency, nocturia and urge incontinence.  Significant improvement or cure was obtained in 70 per cent of enuretic children, and 66 per cent of men and 74 per cent of women with unstable detrusor function.

"[SOC]###context: Ciliopathies are a group of disorders caused by a defect in ciliogenesis, ciliary protein trafficking.  Because nearly every cell in the body (including the photoreceptors) contains cilia, defects in ciliary proteins typically affect multiple organ systems.  Genetic defects affecting the structure or function of cilia can lead to a broad range of developmental and degenerative diseases known as ciliopathies.   Ciliopathies can arise both as a result of genetic variants in spliceosomal proteins, or as a result of variants affecting splicing of specific cilia genes.  Dysregulation of the ciliary dynamics is linked with hereditary disorders, so called ""ciliopathy"", with clinical manifestations of microcephaly, polycystic kidney, situs inversus, polydactyly, and so on.  These systemic disorders include abnormalities in cardiovascular, portal, pancreatic and gastrointestinal systems.  ADPKD is considered to be among the ciliopathy diseases due to the association with abnormal primary cilia function BACKGROUND: Meckel-Gruber syndrome is a ciliopathy, a lethal autosomal recessive disorder that occurs in all races and ethnicities; it is characterized by central nervous system abnormalities, resulting in mental retardation, bilateral renal cystic dysplasia and malformations of hands a Loss of cilia and ciliary protein causes various abnormalities (called ciliopathy), including situs inversus, renal cystic diseases, polydactyly and dysgenesis of the nervous system.  Renal ver, none of these ciliogenic genes has been linked to ciliopathy, a group of disorders caused by abnormal formation or function of cilia.  To dete a ciliopathy, a spectrum of disorders whose causative genes encode proteins involved in the primary cilium apparatus.  In order Mutations in genes encoding cilia proteins cause human ciliopathies, diverse disorders affecting many tissues.  The dysfunction of cilia causes diseases known as ciliopathies.  Ciliopathy encompasses a diverse group of autosomal recessive genetic disorders caused by mutations in genes coding for components of the primary cilia.  'Ciliopathies' are an emerging class of genetic multisystemic human disorders that are caused by a multitude of largely unrelated genes that affect ciliary structure/function.  Ciliopathies are a class of inherited pleiotropic genetic disorders in which alterations in cilia assembly, maintenance, and/or function exhibit penetrance in the multiple organ systems.  The ""ciliopathies"" are a newly defined group of disorders characterized by defects in the structure or function of the cellular primary cilium.  Ciliopathies are a group of hereditary disorders that result from structural or functional abnormalities of cilia.  Ciliopathies are a group of genetic diseases caused by defects in the function of cilia, that are cellular processes composed of a microtubule-based core.  Ciliopathies are human disorders caused by dysfunction of primary cilia, ubiquitous organelles involved in transduction of environmental signals such as light sensation in photoreceptors.  Ciliopathies are disorders caused by ciliary dysfunction and can affect an organ system or tissues.  Ciliopathies are life-threatening human diseases caused by defective cilia.  The ciliopathies are due to defects of the cellular antenna known as the primary cilium, a microtubule-based extension of cellular membranes found in nearly all cell types.  Ciliopathies are a large group of human disorders caused by dysfunction of primary or motile cilia and unified by their overlapping clinical features (brain malformations, retinal dystrophy, cystic kidney disease, liver fibrosis and skeletal abnormalities).  Ciliopathies are unified by their overlapping clinical features and underlying mechanisms involving ciliary dysfunction.  Ciliopathies are a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous group of human developmental disorders whose root cause is the absence or dysfunction of primary cilia.

"[SOC]###context: GRIA3 missense mutation is cause of an x-linked developmental and epileptic encephalopathy.  We report a patient carrying a hemizygous missense variant c. 2359 G > A (p. Glu787Lys) inGRIA3 gene.  Following a literature search, we also reviewed clinical, electrophysiological, radiological, and genetic features of 19 patients with GRIA3 mutations. RESULTS: This 26-month-old boy had developmental delay, early onset refractory myoclonic epilepsy, and non-convulsive refractory status epilepticus.  In published reports, epilepsy was in 6 of 19 patients carrying different genotypes, though epilepsy and electroencephalogram features were not completely defined.  Out of the 6 patients, one presented with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, two with myoclonic and clonic events (one also presented with epileptic spasms), and one with atypical absences and myoclonic jerks.  Information on type of epilepsy was unavailable for 3 cases.  Epilepsy onset was early in life and there was potential tendency for myoclonic/clonic events.  The epilepsy was difficult to treat and prognosis is poor.  Severity of ID ranged from mild to severe and was variably associated with bipolar affective disorder and autistic spectrum disorders.  Other neurological features included hypotonia, asthenic body habitus with poor muscle bulk, and hyporeflexia. CONCLUSION: Our report expands knowledge on the electro-clinical and molecular spectrum of GRIA3 variants.  Larger investigations will better define the prevalence of epilepsy, the epileptic phenotype, and syndromic features underlying GRIA3 variants.  Missense variants in the N-terminal domain of the A isoform of FHF2/FGF13 cause an X-linked developmental and epileptic encephalopathy.  Fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs) are intracellular proteins which regulate voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels in the brain and other tissues.  FHF dysfunction has been linked to neurological disorders including epilepsy.  Here, we describe two sibling pairs and three unrelated males who presented in infancy with intractable focal seizures and severe developmental delay.  Whole-exome sequencing identified hemi- and heterozygous variants in the N-terminal domain of the A isoform of FHF2 (FHF2A).  The X-linked FHF2 gene (also known as FGF13) has alternative first exons which produce multiple protein isoforms that differ in their N-terminal sequence.  The variants were located at highly conserved residues in the FHF2A inactivation particle that competes with the intrinsic fast inactivation mechanism of Nav channels.  Functional characterization of mutant FHF2A co-expressed with wild-type Nav1. 6 (SCN8A) revealed that mutant FHF2A proteins lost the ability to induce rapid-onset, long-term blockade of the channel while retaining pro-excitatory properties.  These gain-of-function effects are likely to increase neuronal excitability consistent with the epileptic potential of FHF2 variants.  Our findings demonstrate that FHF2 variants are a cause of infantile-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy and underline the critical role of the FHF2A isoform in regulating Nav channel function.

"[SOC]###context: Here, we report evidence of the overexpression of DNA methyltransferases 3B (DNMT3B) in invasive cervical cancer and of the inhibition of metastasis by DNMT3B interference.  This study was designed to determine the significance of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in DNA hypermethylation in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and to identify DNA methylation markers in serum for the early diagnosis of ESCC.  DNA methyltransferase 1 as a predictive biomarker and potential therapeutic target for chemotherapy in gastric cancer.  We examined the prognostic and predictive impact of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1 and 3b expression in gastric carcinomas (GC) treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  High DNMT1 and DNMT3b expression was found in 105/127 (83%) and 79/127 (62%) carcinomas, respectively.  Tumoral DNMT3b mRNA up-regulation was significantly correlated with hypermethylation of multiple tumor-related genes (P=0. 021).  A regulator of de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B, DNMT3L promoter was found to have lost DNA methylation to varying levels in 14 out of 15 cancer cervix samples analysed.  The present study highlights the importance of DNA methylation profile at DNMT3L promoter not only as a promising biomarker for cervical cancer, which is the second most common cancer among women worldwide, but also provides insight into the possible role of DNMT3L in cancer development.  DNMT3L is a novel marker and is essential for the growth of human embryonal carcinoma.  Among the DNMT genes, we found that mRNA for DNMT3L was specifically expressed in TGCTs, but neither in normal testicular tissues nor in cancer cells of somatic tissue origin.  DNMT3L protein was strongly expressed in two EC cell lines, but not in the cell lines of somatic tissue origin.  Positive nuclear labeling for DNMT3a was found only in few neoplasms: 1 pleomorphic adenoma (9. 0%), 2 adenoid cystic carcinoma (16. 6%) and 1 mucoepidermoid (9. 0%) cases.  CONCLUSIONS: Our results were not able to demonstrate a clear correlation between DNMT1 and DNMT3a immunoexpression and salivary gland neoplasms development.  DNA methylation, mediated by the combined action of three DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B), is essential for mammalian development and is a major contributor to cellular transformation.  The prevalence, the prognostic effect, and interaction with other molecular markers of DNMT3A mutations was studied in 415 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) younger than 60 years.  The recent identification of DNMT3A mutations in de novo acute myeloid leukemia prompted us to determine their frequency, patterns and clinical impact in a cohort of 98 patients with either therapy-related or secondary acute myeloid leukemia developing from an antecedent hematologic disorder.  DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1 and DNMT3b) were also decreased in vorinostat-treated A549 cancer cells.  To identify the mechanisms responsible for these genome-wide DNA methylation alterations, we measured the gene expression levels of several DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and their interacting proteins by TaqMan qPCR and observed increased expression of DNMT3A2, DNMT3B, and EZH2 in tumors.  DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) is the primary enzyme that maintains DNA methylation.  5-Azactydine inhibits cell growth by direct cytotoxic action as well as by inhibition of DNA methyl transferase enzyme.  Alterations in metabolism of methyl donors, disturbances in activity and/or expression of DNA methyltransferases, and presence of DNA single-strand breaks could contribute to the loss of cytosine methylation during carcinogenesis; however, the precise mechanisms of genomic hypomethylation induced by chemical carcinogens remain largely unknown.  Recently, three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the DNMT3B promoter region, C46359T (-149C>T), -283T>C, and -579G>T have also been reported to be stratification markers that can predict an individual's susceptibility to cancers.  Aberrant DNA methylation has been shown to play important roles during multistage carcinogenesis in various human organs.  Thus, tumour subsets exist that display concurrent decreased BRCA1 expression, BRCA1 promoter methylation, cytoplasmic CTCF expression and with DNMT3b over-expression.  DNA methylation patterns in genome are maintained during replication by a DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1.  Aberrant DNA methylation has been shown to play an important role during multistage carcinogenesis in various human organs.  To investigate the relationship between the expression of DNMT and clinical prognosis in adult patients with acute leukemia (AL), the mRNA expressions of DNMT, p15(INK4B), mdr1 were measured in 72 AL patients and 20 normal controls by semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); the ratio of p15 CpG land methylation was measured in 56 AL patients and 14 normal controls by methylation-specific PCR (MSP-PCR).  DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 ensures clonal transmission of lineage-specific DNA methylation patterns in a mammalian genome during replication.  Overexpression of the major DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 is cytotoxic and has been hypothesized to result in aberrant hypermethylation of genes required for cell survival.  DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) plays an important role in the maintenance of DNA methylation patterns via complicated networks including signaling pathways and transcriptional factors, relating to cell differentiation or carcinogenesis.  We evaluated the significance of aberrant DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) protein expression during gastric carcinogenesis. 
###question: Could DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferases serve as tumour markers?[EOC] [SOR]###response: Yes.  It has been demonstrated in a number of experimental studies that DNA (Cytosine-5-)-methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B) are deregulated in several types of cancer (invasive cervical cancer, colon cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), gastric cancer, embryonal carcinoma, cervical cancer, adenoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, salivary gland neoplasms).  Moreover, three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the DNMT3B promoter region have been reported to be stratification markers that can predict an individual's susceptibility to cancers.

"[SOC]###context: A Recurrent De Novo Nonsense Variant in ZSWIM6 Results in Severe Intellectual Disability without Frontonasal or Limb Malformations.  A recurrent de novo missense variant within the C-terminal Sin3-like domain of ZSWIM6 was previously reported to cause acromelic frontonasal dysostosis (AFND), an autosomal-dominant severe frontonasal and limb malformation syndrome, associated with neurocognitive and motor delay, via a proposed gain-of-function effect.   We show that the c. 2737C>T variant does not trigger nonsense-mediated decay of the ZSWIM6 mRNA in affected individual-derived cells.  This finding supports the existence of a truncated ZSWIM6 protein lacking the Sin3-like domain, which could have a dominant-negative effect.  This study builds support for a key role for ZSWIM6 in neuronal development and function, in addition to its putative roles in limb and craniofacial development, and provides a striking example of different variants in the same gene leading to distinct phenotypes.  Exome sequencing identifies a recurrent de novo ZSWIM6 mutation associated with acromelic frontonasal dysostosis.  Acromelic frontonasal dysostosis (AFND) is a rare disorder characterized by distinct craniofacial, brain, and limb malformations, including frontonasal dysplasia, interhemispheric lipoma, agenesis of the corpus callosum, tibial hemimelia, preaxial polydactyly of the feet, and intellectual disability.  Exome sequencing of one trio and two unrelated probands revealed the same heterozygous variant (c. 3487C>T [p.  Arg1163Trp]) in a highly conserved protein domain of ZSWIM6; this variant has not been seen in the 1000 Genomes data, dbSNP, or the Exome Sequencing Project.  Sanger validation of the three trios confirmed that the variant was de novo and was also present in a fourth isolated proband.  In situ hybridization of early zebrafish embryos at 24 hr postfertilization (hpf) demonstrated telencephalic expression of zswim6 and onset of midbrain, hindbrain, and retinal expression at 48 hpf.  Immunohistochemistry of later-stage mouse embryos demonstrated tissue-specific expression in the derivatives of all three germ layers.  qRT-PCR expression analysis of osteoblast and fibroblast cell lines available from two probands was suggestive of Hedgehog pathway activation, indicating that the ZSWIM6 mutation associated with AFND may lead to the craniofacial, brain and limb malformations through the disruption of Hedgehog signaling.  A recurrent de novo missense variant within the C-terminal Sin3-like domain of ZSWIM6 was previously reported to cause acromelic frontonasal dysostosis (AFND), an autosomal-dominant severe frontonasal and limb malformation syndrome, associated with neurocognitive and motor delay, via a proposed gain-of-function effect.  We present detailed phenotypic information on seven unrelated individuals with a recurrent de novo nonsense variant (c. 2737C>T [p. Arg913Ter]) in the penultimate exon of ZSWIM6 who have severe-profound intellectual disability and additional central and peripheral nervous system symptoms but an absence of frontonasal or limb malformations.  Exome sequencing identifies a recurrent de novo ZSWIM6 mutation associated with acromelic frontonasal dysostosis .  A recurrent de novo missense variant within the C-terminal Sin3-like domain of ZSWIM6 was previously reported to cause acromelic frontonasal dysostosis (AFND), an autosomal-dominant severe frontonasal and limb malformation syndrome, associated with neurocognitive and motor delay, via a proposed gain-of-function effect.

"[SOC]###context: Calsequestrin (CSQ) is a Ca(2+) storage protein that interacts with triadin (TRN), the ryanodine receptor (RyR), and junctin (JUN) to form a macromolecular tetrameric Ca(2+) signaling complex in the cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR).  The decrease of CASQ2 is associated with a reduction in the levels of Triadin (TrD) and Junctin (JnC), two proteins that form, with CASQ2 and RyR2, a macromolecular complex devoted to control of calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.  Triadin and junctin are integral sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins that form a macromolecular complex with the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1) but their roles in skeletal muscle calcium homeostasis remain incompletely understood.  Junctin, a 26 kDa intra-sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) protein, forms a quaternary complex with triadin, calsequestrin and the ryanodine receptor (RyR) at the junctional SR membrane.   In cardiac muscle, junctin forms a quaternary protein complex with the ryanodine receptor (RyR), calsequestrin, and triadin 1 at the luminal face of the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (jSR).  By binding directly the RyR and calsequestrin, junctin may mediate the Ca(2+)-dependent regulatory interactions between both proteins.  Calsequestrin, the major calcium sequestering protein in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle, forms a quaternary complex with the ryanodine receptor calcium release channel and the intrinsic membrane proteins triadin and junctin.   Junctin is a transmembrane protein of the cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) that binds to the ryanodine receptor, calsequestrin, and triadin 1.  This quaternary protein complex is thought to facilitate SR Ca2+ release.  In mammalian striated muscles, ryanodine receptor (RyR), triadin, junctin, and calsequestrin form a quaternary complex in the lumen of sarcoplasmic reticulum.  Such intermolecular interactions contribute not only to the passive buffering of sarcoplasmic reticulum luminal Ca2+, but also to the active Ca2+ release process during excitation-contraction coupling.   Junctin is a major transmembrane protein in cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum, which forms a quaternary complex with the ryanodine receptor (Ca(2+) release channel), triadin, and calsequestrin.   Triadin 1 is a major transmembrane protein in cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), which forms a quaternary complex with the ryanodine receptor (Ca(2+) release channel), junctin, and calsequestrin.  Several key proteins have been localized to junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum which are important for Ca2+ release.  These include the ryanodine receptor, triadin, and calsequestrin, which may associate into a stable complex at the junctional membrane.  We recently purified and cloned a fourth component of this complex, junctin, which exhibits homology with triadin and is the major 125I-calsequestrin-binding protein detected in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles By a combination of approaches including calsequestrin-affinity chromatography, filter overlay, immunoprecipitation assays, and fusion protein binding analyses, we find that junctin binds directly to calsequestrin, triadin, and the ryanodine receptor.   Taken together, these results suggest that junctin, calsequestrin, triadin, and the ryanodine receptor form a quaternary complex that may be required for normal operation of Ca2+ release.  Calsequestrin, the major calcium sequestering protein in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle, forms a quaternary complex with the ryanodine receptor calcium release channel and the intrinsic membrane proteins triadin and junctin.  Junctin, a 26 kDa intra-sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) protein, forms a quaternary complex with triadin, calsequestrin and the ryanodine receptor (RyR) at the junctional SR membrane.  Junctin (JCN), a 26-kd sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) transmembrane protein, forms a quaternary protein complex with the ryanodine receptor, calsequestrin, and triadin in the SR lumen of cardiac muscle.  Junctin (JCN), a 26-kd sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) transmembrane protein, forms a quaternary protein complex with the ryanodine receptor, calsequestrin, and triadin in the SR lumen of cardiac muscle Calsequestrin, the major calcium sequestering protein in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle, forms a quaternary complex with the ryanodine receptor calcium release channel and the intrinsic membrane proteins triadin and junctin Junctin is a major transmembrane protein in cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum, which forms a quaternary complex with the ryanodine receptor (Ca(2+) release channel), triadin, and calsequestrin.

Whole genome and exome sequencing of matched tumor-normal sample pairs is becoming routine in cancer research.  The consequent increased demand for somatic variant analysis of paired samples requires methods specialized to model this problem so as to sensitively call variants at any practical level of tumor impurity. RESULTS: We describe Strelka, a method for somatic SNV and small indel detection from sequencing data of matched tumor-normal samples.  The method uses a novel Bayesian approach which represents continuous allele frequencies for both tumor and normal samples, while leveraging the expected genotype structure of the normal.  This is achieved by representing the normal sample as a mixture of germline variation with noise, and representing the tumor sample as a mixture of the normal sample with somatic variation.  A natural consequence of the model structure is that sensitivity can be maintained at high tumor impurity without requiring purity estimates.  We demonstrate that the method has superior accuracy and sensitivity on impure samples compared with approaches based on either diploid genotype likelihoods or general allele-frequency tests.

the number of calls from the nine somatic variant callers on the same sequencing data and highly variable agreement sequencing depth had markedly diverse impact on individual callers as for some callers increased sequencing depth highly improved sensitivity for snv calling we report ebcall mutect virmid and strelka to be the most reliable somatic variant callers for both exome sequencing and targeted deep sequencing for indel calling ebcall is superior due to high sensitivity and robustness to changes in sequencing depths.  high throughput sequencing is rapidly becoming common practice in

compared the performance of various algorithms on exome data there has not yet been a systematic evaluation using pcr enriched amplicon data with a range of variant allele fractions the recently

method suitable for their specific needs.  identifying genomic variants is a fundamental first step toward the understanding of the role of inherited and acquired variation in disease the accelerating growth in the corpus of sequencing data that underpins such analysis is making the data download bottleneck more evident placing substantial burdens on the research community to keep pace as a result

significance using publicly available data sets.  precision medicine attempts to individualize cancer therapy by matching tumor specific genetic changes with effective targeted therapies a crucial first step in this process is the reliable identification of cancer relevant variants which is considerably complicated by the impurity and heterogeneity of clinical tumor samples we compared the impact of admixture of non cancerous cells and low somatic allele frequencies on the sensitivity and precision of 19 state of the art snv callers we studied both whole exome and targeted gene panel

further found that tumor impurity and admixture had a negative impact on precision and in particular sensitivity in whole exome experiments at admixture levels of 60 to 90 sometimes seen in pathological biopsies sensitivity dropped significantly even when variants were originally present in the tumor at 100 allele frequency sensitivity to low frequency snvs improved with targeted panel data but whole exome data allowed more efficient identification of germline variants effective somatic variant calling requires high quality pathological samples with minimal admixture a consciously

"[SOC]###context: The recently established reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by Takahashi and Yamanaka represents a valuable tool for future therapeutic applications.  In particular, the mechanisms how the Yamanaka factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) directly drive reprogramming and which additional components are involved are still not yet understood.  Here we show that Yamanaka factors (OCT4, SOX2, MYC, and KLF4)-expressing EV can also reprogram adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) into pluripotency, yet at a very low efficiency.  The CytoTune™-iPS Reprogramming Kit contains four SeV-based reprogramming vectors, each capable of expressing one of the four Yamanaka factors (i. e. , Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) and are optimized for generating iPSCs from human somatic cells.  Delivery of the transcription factors Oct4, Klf4, Sox2 and c-Myc via integrating viral vectors has been widely employed to generate induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from both normal and disease-specific somatic tissues, providing an invaluable resource for medical research and drug development.  We demonstrate that residual expression of the Yamanaka factors prevents iPSCs from acquiring the transcriptional program exhibited by embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and that the expression profiles of iPSCs generated with and without c-Myc are indistinguishable.  Fibroblasts can be reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by the application of Yamanaka factors (OSKM), but the mechanisms underlying this reprogramming remain poorly understood.  We also discovered that HMGA1 enhances cellular reprogramming of somatic cells to iPSCs together with the Yamanaka factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, cMYC - OSKM).   Through the ectopic expression of four transcription factors, Oct4, Klf4, Sox2 and cMyc, human somatic cells can be converted to a pluripotent state, generating so-called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)(1-4).  We have shown the generation of transgene-free human iPSCs from patients with different lung diseases using a single excisable polycistronic lentiviral Stem Cell Cassette (STEMCCA) encoding the Yamanaka factors(6).  These iPSCs were established in a feeder-free system by lentiviral transduction of the Yamanaka factors, Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc.  Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are created by the reprogramming of somatic cells via overexpression of certain transcription factors, such as the originally described Yamanaka factors: Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (OSKM) iPSC production was first achieved by transducing, with the use of retroviral vectors, four specific transcription factors: Oct4, Klf4, Sox2 and c-Myc (OKSM), into primary cells in culture Takahashi and Yamanaka, (Cell 126(4):663-676, 2006)

"[SOC]###context: The term ""small round-cell tumor"" describes a group of highly aggressive malignant tumors composed of relatively small and monotonous undifferentiated cells with high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios.  This group includes Ewing's sarcoma (ES), peripheral neuroepithelioma (aka, primitive neuroectodermal tumor or extraskeletal ES), peripheral neuroblastoma (""classic-type""), rhabdomyosarcoma, desmoplastic small round-cell tumor, lymphoma, leukemia, small-cell osteosarcoma, small-cell carcinoma (either undifferentiated or neuroendocrine), olfactory neuroblastoma, cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma (aka, Merkel-cell carcinoma), small-cell melanoma, and mesenchymal chondrosarcoma.  Their clinical presentations often overlap, thus making a definitive diagnosis problematic in some cases AIMS: To retrospectively study the DNA content in a series of childhood Ewing Family Tumors (EFT), and to investigate its prognostic value.  METHODS: The study was performed on a series of 27 EFTs (osseous Ewing's sarcoma, 18 cases; extraosseous Ewing's sarcoma, 2; peripheral neuroepithelioma, 4; Askin Rosai tumors, 3 To improve the prognosis of patients with poor-risk peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors (pPNETs; including peripheral neuroepithelioma and Ewing's sarcoma) Large group of small-round-cell tumours of soft tissues and bone represents a complex diagnostic problem for the pathologists.  Neuronal nature of many tumours from this group is proven by means of new methods--immunophenotypic analysis, tissue culture, cytogenetics.  Peripheral neuroepithelioma, Ewing tumour, primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET), Askin tumour belong to these neoplasms Comparison of Ewing's sarcoma of bone and peripheral neuroepithelioma.  An immunocytochemical and ultrastructural analysis of two primitive neuroectodermal neoplasms Ewing's sarcoma of bone (ESB) and peripheral neuroepithelioma (PN) are frequently considered to be different tumors.  Some researchers have suggested that PN is morphologically a neuroectodermal Ewing's sarcoma.  We sought to determine the extent of neuroectodermal features in conventional ESB on direct patient material (25 cases) and to compare these tumors with a similar group of readily diagnosed PNs (10 cases) Neuroectodermal antigens (neuron-specific enolase, Leu-7 [HNK-1], neurofilament 200 kd, and S100) were found in nine of 10 cases of PN and in 17 of 25 cases of ESB These data support the concept that ESB and PN are both peripheral primitive neuroectodermal neoplasms, differing only in extent of neuroectodermal phenotype and morphological differentiation Besides these antigenic features, Ewing sarcoma cells are characterized by a specific t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation also observed in neuroepithelioma, a neuroectodermal tumor, suggesting a possible evolutionary related origin.  Ewings sarcoma (ES) and peripheral neuroepithelioma (PN) are closely related tumors, and it can be difficult to distinguish them from other small-round-cell tumors (SRCTs).  The presence of this translocation in Ewing sarcoma and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor has been taken as evidence that these two tumors are related.  Besides these antigenic features, Ewing sarcoma cells are characterized by a specific t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation also observed in neuroepithelioma, a neuroectodermal tumor, suggesting a possible evolutionary related origin.  Indistinguishable patterns of protooncogene expression in two distinct but closely related tumors: Ewing's sarcoma and neuroepithelioma.  Ewing's sarcoma (ES) and peripheral neuroepithelioma (PN) are related tumors, possibly of neural crest origin, which are cytogenetically characterized by the specific translocation t(11;22)(q24;q12).  Ewing's sarcoma/peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors (ES/pPNET) are a group of small round cell sarcomas that show varying degrees of neuroectodermal differentiation characterized by translocation involving the EWS gene Ewing's sarcoma (ES) and peripheral neuroepithelioma (PN) are closely related tumors, and it can be difficult to distinguish them from other small-round-cell tumors (SRCTs) Ewing's sarcoma (ES) and peripheral neuroepithelioma (PN) are related tumors, possibly of neural crest origin, which are cytogenetically characterized by the specific translocation t(11;22)(q24;q12) This genetical similarity further supports a nosological concept according to which Askin's tumour, Ewing's sarcoma and peripheral neuroepithelioma represent phenotypic variations of the same tumour, namely the peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumour.  Besides these antigenic features, Ewing sarcoma cells are characterized by a specific t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation also observed in neuroepithelioma, a neuroectodermal tumor, suggesting a possible evolutionary related origin

"[SOC]###context: The secreted protease Adamts18 links hormone action to activation of the mammary stem cell niche.  Estrogens and progesterone control breast development and carcinogenesis via their cognate receptors expressed in a subset of luminal cells in the mammary epithelium.  How they control the extracellular matrix, important to breast physiology and tumorigenesis, remains unclear.  Here we report that both hormones induce the secreted protease Adamts18 in myoepithelial cells by controlling Wnt4 expression with consequent paracrine canonical Wnt signaling activation.  Adamts18 is required for stem cell activation, has multiple binding partners in the basement membrane and interacts genetically with the basal membrane-specific proteoglycan, Col18a1, pointing to the basement membrane as part of the stem cell niche.  In vitro, ADAMTS18 cleaves fibronectin; in vivo, Adamts18 deletion causes increased collagen deposition during puberty, which results in impaired Hippo signaling and reduced Fgfr2 expression both of which control stem cell function.  Thus, Adamts18 links luminal hormone receptor signaling to basement membrane remodeling and stem cell activation.

"[SOC]###context: This randomized, double-blind study (NCT01323972) assessed consistency of three RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine batches formulated from commercial-scale purified antigen bulk lots in terms of anti-CS-responses induced.  Until now, only one candidate malaria vaccine RTS,S/AS01 has shown modest protection in phase 3 trial in African infants.   Efficacy and safety of RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine with or without a booster dose in infants and children in Africa: final results of a phase 3, individually randomised, controlled trial.  BACKGROUND: The efficacy and safety of the RTS,S/AS01 candidate malaria vaccine during 18 months of follow-up have been published previously.   INTERPRETATION: RTS,S/AS01 prevented a substantial number of cases of clinical malaria over a 3-4 year period in young infants and children when administered with or without a booster dose.   WHO anticipates that the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine will be recommended for the 6-14 week age group for co-administration together with other vaccines as part of routine immunization programs in malaria endemic countries.  Recent phase 3 trials with malaria vaccine candidate RTS,S/AS01 (RTS,S) in children has demonstrated modest efficacy against clinical and severe malaria.  The RTS,S/AS01(E) malaria vaccine candidate has recently entered phase III testing.  The efficacy of RTS,S/AS01 as a vaccine for malaria is being tested in a phase 3 clinical trial.  Assessment of severe malaria in a multicenter, phase III, RTS, S/AS01 malaria candidate vaccine trial: case definition, standardization of data collection and patient care.  If the phase III results confirm the observations made during phase II testing, the RTS,S/AS01(E) vaccine, when broadly implemented and judiciously integrated with other malaria-prevention measures, would have a major public-health impact in sub-Saharan Africa.  The RTS,S/AS01(E) malaria vaccine candidate has recently entered Phase 3 testing.  The RTS,S/AS01(E) candidate malaria vaccine is being developed for immunisation of infants in Africa through the expanded programme on immunisation (EPI) The RTS,S/AS01(E) malaria candidate vaccine is being developed for immunization of African infants through the Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) Of the multiple approaches that have been pursued, the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine candidate represents the most developed and clinically validated malaria vaccine formulation AS01 has been selected for the clinical development of several candidate vaccines including the RTS,S malaria vaccine and the subunit glycoprotein E varicella zoster vaccine (both currently in phase III) Safety and efficacy of the RTS,S/AS01E candidate malaria vaccine given with expanded-programme-on-immunisation vaccines: 19 month follow-up of a randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial A randomized trial assessing the safety and immunogenicity of AS01 and AS02 adjuvanted RTS,S malaria vaccine candidates in children in Gabon.  Effect of ingested human antibodies induced by RTS, S/AS01 malaria vaccination in children on Plasmodium falciparum oocyst formation and sporogony in mosquitoes.  The incidence of generalised convulsive seizures within 7 days of RTS,S/AS01 booster was 2�2 per 1000 doses in young infants and 2�5 per 1000 doses in children. INTERPRETATION: RTS,S/AS01 prevented a substantial number of cases of clinical malaria over a 3-4 year period in young infants and children when administered with or without a booster dose.

"[SOC]###context: The Sleeping Beauty and PiggyBac DNA transposon systems have recently been developed as tools for insertional mutagenesis.   The use of nonviral gene delivery approaches in conjunction with the latest generation transposon technology based on Sleeping Beauty (SB) or piggyBac transposons may potentially overcome some of these limitations.   DNA transposons have emerged as flexible and efficient molecular vehicles to mediate stable cargo transfer.  However, the ability to carry DNA fragments>10 kb is limited in most DNA transposons.  Here, we show that the DNA transposon piggyBac can mobilize 100-kb DNA fragments in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, making it the only known transposon with such a large cargo capacity.  The integrity of the cargo is maintained during transposition, the copy number can be controlled and the inserted giant transposons express the genomic cargo.  Furthermore, these 100-kb transposons can also be excised from the genome without leaving a footprint.  The development of piggyBac as a large cargo vector will facilitate a wider range of genetic and genomic applications.  In this report, we harnessed the highly efficient, nonviral, and plasmid-based piggyBac transposon system to enable concurrent genomic integration of multiple independent transposons harboring distinct protein-coding DNA sequences Among the transposons active in mammalian cells, the moth-derived transposon piggyBac is most promising with its highly efficient transposition, large cargo capacity, and precise repair of the donor site Transposons are promising systems for somatic gene integration because they can not only integrate exogenous genes efficiently, but also be delivered to a variety of organs using a range of transfection methods.  piggyBac (PB) transposon has a high transposability in mammalian cells in vitro, and has been used for genetic and preclinical studies Simple piggyBac transposon-based mammalian cell expression system for inducible protein production.  The piggyBac transposon displays local and distant reintegration preferences and can cause mutations at noncanonical integration sites.  The piggyBac transposon was developed as an alternative mutagenic vector for mutagenesis of non-P-element targeted genes in Drosophila because the piggyBac transposon can more randomly integrate into the genome.  Previous studies suggested that the piggyBac transposon always excises precisely from the insertion site without initiating a deletion or leaving behind an additional footprint.  A single injection of piggyBac transposons could achieve long-term inducible gene expression in the livers of mice in vivo, confirming our multiple-transposon strategy used in cultured cells.  The plasmid-based piggyBac transposon system enables constitutive or inducible gene expression in vivo for potential therapeutic and biological applications without using viral vectors.  In this report, we harnessed the highly efficient, nonviral, and plasmid-based piggyBac transposon system to enable concurrent genomic integration of multiple independent transposons harboring distinct protein-coding DNA sequences.  Flow cytometry of cell clones derived from a single multiplexed transfection demonstrated approximately 60% (three transposons) or approximately 30% (four transposons) stable coexpression of all delivered transgenes with selection for a single marker transposon.

The human genome folds to create thousands of intervals, called ""contact domains,"" that exhibit enhanced contact frequency within themselves.  ""Loop domains"" form because of tethering between two loci-almost always bound by CTCF and cohesin-lying on the same chromosome.  ""Compartment domains"" form when genomic intervals with similar histone marks co-segregate.  Here, we explore the effects of degrading cohesin.  All loop domains are eliminated, but neither compartment domains nor histone marks are affected.

"[SOC]###context: Nearly one half of all cases of acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are due to the T790M mutation in EGFR exon 20.   Two types of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in exon 19 and exon 21 (ex19del and L858R) are prevalent in lung cancer patients and sensitive to targeted EGFR inhibition.  A resistance mutation in exon 20 (T790M) has been found to accompany drug treatment when patients relapse.   Acquired EGFR C797S mutation mediates resistance to AZD9291 in non-small cell lung cancer harboring EGFR T790M.  However, resistance to the EGFR TKIs develops mostly secondary to T790M mutation in exon 20.   The T790M mutation in EGFR accounts for approximately half of all lung cancer cases with acquired resistance to the current clinical EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  In nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the threonine(790)-methionine(790) (T790M) point mutation of EGFR kinase is one of the leading causes of acquired resistance to the first generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as gefitinib and erlotinib Both AKT and MEK inhibition contributed to cell death independent of erlotinib in the T790M-containing H1975 and the EGFR-WT cell lines tested.   The EGFR T790M mutation is generally considered to be the molecular genetic basis of acquired TKI resistance Prognostic impact of central nervous system metastases after acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI: poorer prognosis associated with T790M-negative status and leptomeningeal metastases.

We reported the first small molecule inhibitors of the interaction between the clathrin N-terminal domain (TD) and endocyctic accessory proteins (i. e. , clathrin inhibition1).  Tubulobulbar complexes are elaborate clathrin/actin related structures that form at sites of intercellular attachment in the seminiferous epithelium of the mammalian testis.   Clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) are formed at the plasma membrane and act as vectors for endocytosis.  They also assemble at the trans-Golgi network (TGN), but their exact function at this organelle is unclear.    Clathrin immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting showed increased immunoreactivity of clathrin protein in the placental tissues of mice treated with 20- and 50-nm gold nanoparticles; clathrin immunopositivity was observed in syncytiotrophoblasts and fetal endothelial cells.

The selective Janus kinase 1 inhibitor filgotinib (GLPG0634), which is currently in clinical development for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Crohn's disease, demonstrated encouraging safety and efficacy profiles in RA patients after 4 weeks of daily dosing.    In vitro, filgotinib and its active metabolite at clinically relevant concentrations did not interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes and uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases, and did not inhibit key drug transporters.

Functionally, fetal hemoglobin differs most from adult hemoglobin in that it is able to bind oxygen with greater affinity than the adult form, giving the developing fetus better access to oxygen from the mother's bloodstream.  Unusually high levels of fetal haemoglobin production can ameliorate sickle cell disease and β thalassaemia.  Although efforts directed at the pharmacological stimulation of fetal haemoglobin as an approach to managing these conditions have met with limited success, there is wide variation in individual responses.

Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is used in cases of severe respiratory and/or circulatory failure over periods of several days to several weeks INTRODUCTION: Mortality of patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) remains high.  BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a form of long-term cardiopulmonary bypass used to treat infants, children, and adults with respiratory and/or cardiac failure despite maximal medical therapy.  PURPOSE: Optimal timing of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) repair in patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) remains controversial.  Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a support modality used within the pediatric cardiac ICU population as a bridge to recovery or decision in the setting of acute myocardial decompensation, support for combined cardiopulmonary failure or in the setting of refractory cardiopulmonary arrest.  Pati OBJECTIVE: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a widely used technique for treating postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock (PCS); however, no study has compared the long-term outcomes of patients who receive ECMO support for PCS with those of the general population post cardiac su Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a kind of technique that uses extracorporeal circulation system to draw patients' blood into the circuit, and then oxygenate the blood when it passes along the membrane, followed by returning the blood into patients.

"[SOC]###context: RESULTS: fourteen randomized clinical trials were identified (7 with bevacizumab, 2 cilengitide, 1 enzastaurin, 1 dasatinib, 1 vandetanib, 1 temsirolimus, 1 cediranib) including 4330 patients.  Antiangiogenic drugs showed no improvement in overall survival with a pooled HR of 1. 00, a trend for an inferior outcome, in terms of overall survival, was observed in the group of patients receiving antiangiogenic drug alone compared to cytotoxic drug alone (HR=1. 24, p=0. 056).  CONCLUSIONS: Intraparticipant dose escalation was feasible, but dasatinib was ineffective in recurrent GBM.   Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 1. 35 months (95% confidence interval: 1. 2-1. 4) and 6-month PFS was 7. 7%.  In this phase I study of recurrent glioblastoma patients, the combination of CCNU and dasatinib showed significant hematological toxicities and led to suboptimal exposure to both agents.  Dasatinib in conjunction with bevacizumab does not appear to have activity in patients with recurrent, heavily pretreated GBM.

"[SOC]###context: The aporphine alkaloids (+)-dicentrine and (+)-bulbocapnine are non-planar molecules lacking features normally associated with DNA binding by intercalation or minor groove binding.  Surprisingly, dicentrine showed significant activity as a topoisomerase II (EC 5. 99. 1. 3) inhibitor and also was active in a DNA unwinding assay.  The DNA unwinding suggests DNA intercalation, which could explain the inhibition of topoisomerase II.  We found that several agents, including adriamycin (a DNA intercalator and inhibitor of topoisomerase II) Amsacrine, a DNA intercalator and topoisomerase II inhibitor, is efficacious as an antileukemogenic agent.  Quinacrine was less effective.  (ii) Inhibitors intercalating and binding to the 'cleavable' DNA-topoisomerase complex (m-AMSA, mitoxantrone, doxorubicin and daunorubicin) strongly suppressed reparative DNA incision.   DNA intercalation and inhibition of topoisomerase II.  Among its many properties, amiloride is a DNA intercalator and topoisomerase II inhibitor.  To determine whether the ability of amiloride to intercalate into DNA and to inhibit DNA topoisomerase II was dependent on the ability to assume a cyclized conformation, we studied the structure-activity relationship for 12 amiloride analogs Empirical assays consisting of biophysical, biochemical, and cell biological approaches, as well as computational molecular modeling approaches, were used to determine conformational properties for these molecules, and to determine whether they intercalated into DNA and inhibited topoisomerase II.   Results indicated that only those analogs capable of cyclization could intercalate into DNA and inhibit topoisomerase II.  Thus, the ability of amiloride and the 12 analogs studied to intercalate into DNA and to inhibit topoisomerase II appears dependent on the ability to exist in a planar, hydrogen-bonded, tricyclic conformation.  Abnormal expression of the nuclear-associated enzyme DNA topoisomerase II (topoisomerase II) has been implicated in the in vitro phenotype of radiation hypersensitive ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) cells and in modifying sensitivity of eukaryotic cells to topoisomerase II-inhibitor drugs [e. g. , the DNA intercalator amsacrine (mAMSA)].   All three tested anthraquinones, emodin, aloe-emodin, and danthron, showed capabilities to inhibit the non-covalent binding of bisbenzimide Hoechst 33342 to isolated DNA and in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells comparable to the topoisomerase II inhibitor and intercalator m-amsacrine.  These studies suggest that AD 288 inhibits topoisomerase II activity by preventing the initial non-covalent binding of topoisomerase II to DNA.  Since AD 288 is a potent DNA intercalator, catalytic inhibition is achieved by prohibiting access of the enzyme to DNA binding sites.   AQ4N (1,4-bis[[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl] amino]-5,8-dihydroxyanthracene-9, 10-dione bis-N-oxide dihydrochloride) is a prodrug which is selectively activated within hypoxic tissues to AQ4, a topoisomerase II inhibitor and DNA intercalator.  Amonafide is a DNA intercalator and topoisomerase II inhibitor in clinical development for the treatment of neoplastic diseases.   We found that three compounds had similar cancer cell-selective growth inhibition to amonafide, while retaining similar subcellular localization, DNA intercalation and topoisomerase II inhibition activities.  Amonafide is a novel topoisomerase II (Topo II) inhibitor and DNA intercalator that induces apoptotic signaling by blocking the binding of Topo II to DNA.  At higher concentrations, inhibition of Top1 catalytic activity and DNA intercalation is observed.  Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of new oligopyrrole carboxamides linked with tricyclic DNA-intercalators as potential DNA ligands or topoisomerase inhibitors.  It was found that 1) morpholinyldoxorubicin, cyanomorpholinyldoxorubicin, and Actinomycin D (but not doxorubicin) stimulated DNA topoisomerase I-induced cleavage at specific DNA sites; 2) only doxorubicin and Actinomycin D stimulated DNA cleavage by DNA topoisomerase II; 3) at higher drug concentrations, DNA intercalators suppressed enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage induced by DNA topoisomerase I, as well as topoisomerase II; 4) only cyanomorpholinyldoxorubicin produced DNA-DNA cross-links; no DNA unwinding could be observed; and 5) DNA intercalation (unwinding) potency of morpholinyldoxorubicin was about 2-fold less than that of doxorubicin.  The data indicate that some DNA intercalators are not only inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase II but act also on DNA topoisomerase I.  The screen of cMAP for uncharacterized drugs indicated the signature of Epoxy anthraquinone derivative (EAD) matched the profiles of multiple known DNA targeted agents (topoisomerase I/II inhibitors, DNA intercalators, and DNA alkylation agents) as predicted by its structure.  Cytotoxicity of several classes of antitumor DNA intercalators is thought to result from disturbance of DNA metabolism following trapping of the nuclear enzyme DNA topoisomerase II as a covalent complex on DNA.  Most DNA intercalators and epipodophyllotoxins inhibit mammalian topoisomerase II by trapping the enzyme within DNA cleavage complexes that can be detected in cells as protein-associated DNA strand breaks.  Many compounds capable of inhibiting DNA topoisomerase II are DNA intercalators.  Numerous topoisomerase I poisons including DNA minor groove binders such as Hoechst 33258 and DNA intercalators such as benzophenanthridine alkaloids and indolocarbazole derivatives have been discovered and developed.  The stabilization of cleavage intermediates by intercalators may have a common mechanism for DNA topoisomerase I and DNA topoisomerase II.  Because structurally related antitumor alkaloids such as camptothecin and fagaronine are known to function as intercalative topoisomerase poisons, it is hypothesized that cytotoxic Stauranthus alkaloids may also serve as intercalative topoisomerase inhibitors.  Taken together, our results suggest that much of the activity and specificity of m-AMSA as a topoisomerase II poison is embodied in the headgroup, while DNA intercalation is used primarily to increase the affinity of m-AMSA for the topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complex.  The cross-sensitivity patterns of the mutant were examined for covalently (anthramycin) and non-covalently (distamycin A) binding minor groove ligands, and DNA intercalating [adriamycin, mitoxantrone and 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulphon-m-anisidide (mAMSA)] and non-intercalating (VP16-213) topoisomerase II poisons.  Quinoline alkaloids as intercalative topoisomerase inhibitors.  DNA intercalation and inhibition of topoisomerase II.  Structure-activity relationships for a series of amiloride analogs.  These include: (i) the production of improved topoisomerase inhibitors (by consideration of drug/protein as well as drug/DNA interactions); (ii) the development of reductively-activated chromophores as hypoxia-selective agents; and (iii) the use of DNA-intercalators of known DNA binding orientation as 'carriers' for the delivery of other reactive functionality specifically (sequence-, regio- and site-specifically) to DNA.  Indolo[2,3-b]quinolines are a family of DNA intercalators and inhibitors of topoisomerase II, synthetic analogs of neocryptolepine, an alkaloid traditionally used in African folk medicine.  Their ability to function as bis-intercalators was assessed by a novel and convenient topoisomerase fluorescent assay.  Structure-activity relationship of polypyridyl ruthenium(II) complexes as DNA intercalators, DNA photocleavage reagents, and DNA topoisomerase and RNA polymerase inhibitors.  In addition, fragments of about 900 kbp were detected in the cells treated with a topoisomerase inhibitor, 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methane-sulfon-m-anisidine, and fragments in the broad size range between 700 and 245 kbp in the cells treated with radical producers, bleomycin and neocarzinostatin.   The data indicate that some DNA intercalators are not only inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase II but act also on DNA topoisomerase I.   Long-term inhibition of DNA synthesis and the persistence of trapped topoisomerase II complexes in determining the toxicity of the antitumor DNA intercalators mAMSA and mitoxantrone.  Effects of the DNA intercalators 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide and 2-methyl-9-hydroxyellipticinium on topoisomerase II mediated DNA strand cleavage and strand passage.  Most DNA intercalators and epipodophyllotoxins inhibit mammalian topoisomerase II by trapping the enzyme within DNA cleavage complexes that can be detected in cells as protein-associated DNA strand breaks.   Here, molecular interactions of the potent antitumor drug amsacrine (m-AMSA), an inhibitor of topoisomerase II, within living K562 cancer cells have been studied using surface-enhanced Raman (SER) spectroscopy.   It has been shown previously that DNA intercalators can inhibit the action of amsacrine and several other topoisomerase II poisons, presumably as a result of interference with the DNA binding sites for the enzyme.   The gadd153 promoter was strongly activated by a broad spectrum of genotoxic agents including UV-mimetic agents, DNA-cross-linking and alkylating agents, DNA intercalators, and topoisomerase inhibitors.   Our study indicates that Epoxy anthraquinone derivative may be a novel DNA topoisomerase inhibitor that can be potentially used for treatment of neuroblastoma or other cancer patients.  Organic intercalators can inhibit nucleic acid synthesis in vivo, and they are now common anticancer drugs in clinical therapy.   Because structurally related antitumor alkaloids such as camptothecin and fagaronine are known to function as intercalative topoisomerase poisons, it is hypothesized that cytotoxic Stauranthus alkaloids may also serve as intercalative topoisomerase inhibitors.  Specifically, we measured the ability of these compounds to 1) alter the thermal denaturation profile of DNA, 2) modify the hydrodynamic behavior of DNA, 3) inhibit the catalytic activity of purified DNA topoisomerase II in vitro, 4) promote the topoisomerase II-dependent cleavage of DNA, and 5) inhibit functions associated with DNA topoisomerase II in intact cells.  Results indicated that only those analogs capable of cyclization could intercalate into DNA and inhibit topoisomerase II.  A function for topoisomerases I and II in DNA excision repair can be postulated from the organization of the mammalian chromosome, involving nucleosomal structures and matrix-attached DNA loops.  To analyse this function we determined UV-induced DNA incision in confluent human fibroblasts in the presence of 16 inhibitors of topoisomerases I and II which belonged to at least five different drug categories, based on their mechanism of action.  In experiments to determine the mechanism of inhibition of DNA synthesis by amiloride, we observed that amiloride inhibited both the catalytic activity of purified DNA topoisomerase II in vitro and DNA topoisomerase II-dependent cell functions in vivo.  Many compounds capable of inhibiting DNA topoisomerase II are DNA intercalators.  The pyridoacridines&apos; ability to inhibit TOPO II-mediated decatenation of kDNA correlated with their cytotoxic potencies and their ability to intercalate into calf thymus DNA.  These results suggest that disruption of the function of TOPO II, subsequent to intercalation, is a probable mechanism by which pyridoacridines inhibit the proliferation of HCT cells.  Evidence for DNA intercalation by AD41 is provided by the observation that the drug introduces positive supercoils into covalently closed plasmid DNA.  Based on these data, a hypothesis is proposed that would provide a general mechanism whereby intercalating agents and epipodophyllotoxins alter topoisomerase function and presumably exert their antitumor effects.  Therefore, to more fully analyze structure-function relationships and the role of DNA binding in the action of m-AMSA, we analyzed a series of derivatives for the ability to enhance DNA cleavage mediated by human topoisomerase IIα and topoisomerase IIβ and to intercalate DNA.  Results indicate that the 3&apos;-methoxy (m-AMSA) positively affects drug function, potentially by restricting the rotation of the headgroup in a favorable orientation.

In conclusion, HAMP and hemojuvelin mutations are rare among Spanish HH patients, and their impact in this population is not significant.  Juvenile hemochromatosis (JH) is the most severe form, usually caused by mutations in hemojuvelin (HJV) or hepcidin (HAMP).   We have identified novel mutations in HJV, HAMP, and SLC40A1 in countries not normally associated with hereditary hemochromatosis (Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Thailand).

Here, we integrate measures of how essential a gene is to supporting life, as inferred from viability and phenotyping screens performed on knockout mice by the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium and essentiality screens carried out on human cell lines.  We propose a cross-species gene classification across the Full Spectrum of Intolerance to Loss-of-function (FUSIL) and demonstrate that genes in five mutually exclusive FUSIL categories have differing biological properties.  Most notably, Mendelian disease genes, particularly those associated with developmental disorders, are highly overrepresented among genes non-essential for cell survival but required for organism development.  After screening developmental disorder cases from three independent disease sequencing consortia, we identify potentially pathogenic variants in genes not previously associated with rare diseases.  We therefore propose FUSIL as an efficient approach for disease gene discovery.

"[SOC]###context: In human cells, Pol III genes and transcription factors have also been shown to colocalize with cohesin and the transcription regulator and genome organizer CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF).  To investigate cohesin-non-CTCF (CNC) binding events in vivo we mapped cohesin and CTCF, as well as a collection of tissue-specific and ubiquitous transcriptional regulators using ChIP-seq in primary mouse liver.   In contrast to regions of the genome where cohesin and CTCF colocalize, CNC sites coincide with the binding of master regulators and enhancer-markers and are significantly associated with liver-specific expressed genes.   Finally, we observe that the presence of mirrored CTCF binding events at promoters and their nearby cohesin-bound enhancers is associated with elevated expression levels.  Recently, cohesins have been implicated in transcriptional regulation and insulation through genome-wide colocalization with the insulator protein CTCF, including involvement at the imprinted H19/Igf2 locus.  Here we report that cohesins colocalize with CTCF at two additional imprinted loci, the Dlk1-Dio3 and the Kcnq1/Kcnq1ot1 loci.    To determine the functional importance of the binding of CTCF and cohesins at the three imprinted loci, CTCF and cohesins were depleted in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells.  Results of these experiments demonstrate an unappreciated role for CTCF and cohesins in the repression of imprinted genes in somatic cells.  Here, we show in different cell types that cohesin functionally behaves as a tissue-specific transcriptional regulator, independent of CTCF binding.  By performing matched genome-wide binding assays (ChIP-seq) in human breast cancer cells (MCF-7), we discovered thousands of genomic sites that share cohesin and estrogen receptor alpha (ER) yet lack CTCF binding By use of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2), we found that liver-specific transcription factors colocalize with cohesin independently of CTCF at liver-specific targets that are distinct from those found in breast cancer cells Together, our data show that cohesin cobinds across the genome with transcription factors independently of CTCF, plays a functional role in estrogen-regulated transcription, and may help to mediate tissue-specific transcriptional responses via long-range chromosomal interactions.   Because cohesin can colocalize with CTCF, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation for the cohesin subunit Rad21 and found lineage and stage-specific Rad21 recruitment to CTCF in all Ig loci.  The differential binding of cohesin to CTCF sites may promote multiple loop formation and thus effective V(D)J recombination These numerous CTCF/cohesin sites potentially form the bases of the multiloop rosette structures at the Igh locus that compact during Ig heavy chain rearrangement.  We conclude that cohesins interact with CTCF in mid-S phase and repress CTCF-regulated genes in a cell cycle-dependent manner.  We propose that the CTCF-cohesin complex plays a critical role in regulating the cell cycle control of viral gene expression during latency and that failure to maintain cell cycle control of latent transcripts inhibits host cell proliferation and survival We conclude that cohesin subunits associate with viral and cellular CTCF sites involved in complex gene regulation and chromatin organization.  Because cohesin can colocalize with CTCF, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation for the cohesin subunit Rad21 and found lineage and stage-specific Rad21 recruitment to CTCF in all Ig loci.  In human cells, Pol III genes and transcription factors have also been shown to colocalize with cohesin and the transcription regulator and genome organizer CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF).  Here, we show that ATRX, MeCP2, and cohesin, chromatin regulators implicated in ATR-X, RTT, and CdLS syndromes, respectively, interact in the brain and colocalize at the H19 imprinting control region (ICR) with preferential binding on the maternal allele.  Subcellular distribution of CTCF and colocalization with cohesins also varied across the cell cycle.   ChIP sequencing was performed on pro-B cells, revealing colocalization of CTCF and Rad21 binding at ~60 sites throughout the V(H) region and 2 other sites within the Igh locus.   Recently, cohesins have been implicated in transcriptional regulation and insulation through genome-wide colocalization with the insulator protein CTCF, including involvement at the imprinted H19/Igf2 locus.   CTCF colocalizes with cohesin but not RNA Polymerase II.

"[SOC]###context: The prediction of the complete structure of genes is one of the very important tasks of bioinformatics, especially in eukaryotes.  A crucial part in the gene structure prediction is to determine the splice sites in the coding region.  Identification of splice sites depends on the precise recognition of the boundaries between exons and introns of a given DNA sequence.  This problem can be formulated as a classification of sequence elements into 'exon-intron' (EI), 'intron-exon' (IE) or 'None' (N) boundary classes.  The proposed WPSS method poses efficient results compared with the performance of many methods proposed in the literature.  SCGPred: a score-based method for gene structure prediction by combining multiple sources of evidence.  Moreover, computational gene finding in newly sequenced genomes is especially a difficult task due to the absence of a training set of abundant validated genes.  Here we present a new gene-finding program, SCGPred, to improve the accuracy of prediction by combining multiple sources of evidence.  Therefore, SCG-Pred can serve as an alternative gene-finding tool for newly sequenced eukaryotic genomes.  The program is freely available at http://bio. scu. edu. cn/SCGPred/.  Incorporation of splice site probability models for non-canonical introns improves gene structure prediction in plants.

In this paper, we show that Nrd1 and Nab3 are required for transcription termination of CUTs These results suggest that transcription termination of CUTs directed by Nrd1 and Nab3 is a prerequisite for rapid degradation by the nuclear exosome.   It is likely that many of these are cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs), which are rapidly degraded and whose function(s) within the cell are still unclear, while others may be novel functional transcripts.  These recently identified transcripts either exist stably in cells (stable unannotated transcripts, SUTs) or are rapidly degraded by the RNA surveillance pathway (cryptic unstable transcripts, CUTs) One characteristic of pervasive transcription is the extensive overlap of SUTs and CUTs with previously annotated features, which prompts questions regarding how these transcripts are generated, and whether they exert function Single-gene studies have shown that transcription of SUTs and CUTs can be functional, through mechanisms involving the generated RNAs or their generation itself We show that both SUTs and CUTs display distinct patterns of distribution at specific locations Cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) were recently described as a principal class of RNA polymerase II transcripts in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Although CUT degradation mechanisms have been analysed in detail, the genome-wide distribution at the nucleotide resolution and the prevalence of CUTs are unknown.  Here we report the first high-resolution genomic map of CUTs in yeast, revealing a class of potentially functional CUTs and the intrinsic bidirectional nature of eukaryotic promoters  The resulting detailed genomic map of CUTs revealed that they derive from extremely widespread and very well defined transcription units and do not result from unspecific transcriptional noise.  the transcription of CUTs predominantly arises within nucleosome-free regions, most of which correspond to promoter regions of bona fide genes.  Some of the CUTs start upstream from messenger RNAs and overlap their 5' end.  most of the identified CUTs corresponded to transcripts divergent from the promoter regions of genes, indicating that they represent by-products of divergent transcription occurring at many and possibly most promoters.   Most of these ncRNAs (ncRNAs) are subject to termination by the Nrd1-dependent pathway and rapid degradation by the nuclear exosome and have been dubbed cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs).  CUTs are often considered as by-products of transcriptional noise, but in an increasing number of cases they play a central role in the control of gene expression Regulatory mechanisms involving expression of a CUT are diverse and include attenuation, transcriptional interference, and alternative transcription start site choice It is well established that eukaryotic genomes are pervasively transcribed producing cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs).  We show that loss of abp1 results in the accumulation of CUTs, which are targeted for degradation by the exosome pathway.  Here, by examining the overlap of stable (SUTs, stable unannotated transcripts) and unstable (CUTs, cryptic unstable transcripts) transcripts with protein-coding genes, we show that the predicted Nrd1 and Nab3-binding site sequences occur at differing frequencies.  Cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) are a largely unexplored class of nuclear exosome degraded, non-coding RNAs in budding yeast.  It is highly debated whether CUT transcription has a functional role in the cell or whether CUTs represent noise in the yeast transcriptome.   By identifying configurations of gene-CUT pairs, where CUT expression originates from the gene 5' or 3' nucleosome free region, we observed distinct gene expression trends specific to these configurations which were most prevalent in the presence of conserved CUT expression.   Furthermore we provide the first assessment of conserved CUT expression in yeast and globally demonstrate possible modes of CUT-based regulation of gene expression.  Most of these ncRNAs (ncRNAs) are subject to termination by the Nrd1-dependent pathway and rapid degradation by the nuclear exosome and have been dubbed cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs).  Some are designated Cryptic Unstable Transcripts (CUTs) because they are terminated by the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 pathway and then rapidly degraded by the nuclear exosome.

"[SOC]###context: Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) are frequently observed in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as gefitinib and erlotinib, have transformed therapy for patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC and have proved superior to chemotherapy as first-line treatment for this patient group.  Adenocarcinomas, the most common histologic subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), are frequently associated with activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene.  Although these patients often respond clinically to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib, Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as gefitinib and erlotinib are promising therapies for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Patients with somatic activating mutations in the EGFR gene have dramatic response initially, but would eventually develop resistance to these TKIs.  NSCLCs with EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletions or the exon 21 L858R) attain responses to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib and erlotinib, with improved response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS) and in some reports overall survival (OS) when compared with EGFR wildtype (WT) cases.  Patients presenting with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and active EGFR mutation have a high response rate (60-70%) to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) with little immediate progression (primary resistance).  Lung cancers harboring mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) respond to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, but drug resistance invariably emerges.  EGFR-TKI yields a long survival period in cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), especially those with EGFR gene mutations, Efficacy of erlotinib was recognized in the cases in which disease control was obtained by initial treatment with gefitinib.  Patients with lung adenocarcinoma who carry epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations respond remarkably well to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), gefitinib, or erlotinib.  lung adenocarcinomas with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations respond to treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib and erlotinib; The development of resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) seems almost inevitable, even in patients with lung cancer that initially respond well to EGFR-TKIs.  Gefitinib- or erlotinib-resistant sublines were established by exposing the parental PC-9 cell line to chronic, repeated treatments with these drugs.  These resistant sublines showed more than 100-fold more resistance to gefitinib and erlotinib and acquired cross-resistance to other EGFR-TKIs.  The T790M EGFR mutation was found by pyrosequencing, and this seemed to be the cause of drug resistance.  Patients with advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma exhibiting overexpression or mutation of epidermal growth factor receptor tend to respond better to targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib and erlotinib.  Mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene have been reported in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), especially in patients with adenocarcinoma and never smokers.  Some common somatic mutations in EGFR, including deletion mutations in exon 19 and leucine-to-arginine substitution at amino acid position 858 (L858R) in exon 21, have been examined for their ability to predict sensitivity to gefitinib or erlotinib, which are selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs).  Somatic mutations in exons encoding the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are found in human lung adenocarcinomas and are associated with sensitivity to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib.  Somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are present in lung adenocarcinomas that respond to the EGFR inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib.  Epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor(TKI)(such as gefitinib or erlotinib)treatment of lung cancer harboring EGFR gene mutation is one of the prototypes of such therapies.  patients with NSCLC and CNS metastases with epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutations who received CSF examinations during epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors treatment (250 mg daily gefitinib or 150 mg daily erlotinib).  The evidence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) such as gefitinib and erlotinib was first confirmed as the second-line treatment for non-selective patients with advanced NSCLC.  patients with EGFR-mutated advanced NSCLC, the first-line treatment with gefitinib had achieved a significant prolongation of progression-free survival compared with standard platinum doublet chemotherapy in a few phase III trials, and became a new standard of care.  Gefitinib is highly effective for patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutation even if their performance status is poor, although one should always pay careful attention to fatal interstitial lung disease.  The tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib and erlotinib are effective in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations.  Somatic mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are associated with the responses to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib, erlotinib), which are molecularly targeted drugs, and it has now become possible to select treatment methods by choosing from a number of anticancer drugs.  EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been demonstrated to have a very high cytoreductive effect on lung cancers that have EGFR gene mutations.  EGFR gene mutations at kinase domain in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have been examined for their ability to predict sensitivity to gefitinib or erlotinib.  responsive patients can relapse as a result of selection for EGFR gene mutations that confer resistance to ATP competitive EGFR inhibitors, such as erlotinib and gefitinib.  the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was a therapeutic target in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other cancers led to development of the small-molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib.  There was a significant correlation between EGFR gene copy number, EGFR gene mutations, and gefitinib sensitivity.  Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations have been found in a subset of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with good clinical response to gefitinib therapy.  Mutations in the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene in non-small cell lung cancers are associated with increased sensitivity of these cancers to drugs that inhibit EGFR kinase activity such as gefitinib and erlotinib.  Somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reportedly associated with sensitivity of lung cancers to gefitinib (Iressa), kinase inhibitor.  frequently containing mutations within the TK domain of EGFR that are associated with gefitinib and erlotinib sensitivity.

In Escherichia coli, the MutHLS system is known to function in MMR, and homologues of MutS and MutL are widely conserved in almost all organisms.  A simple genetic system has been developed to test the effect of over-expression of wild-type or mutated human MutL homologue 1 (hMLH1) proteins on methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) in Escherichia coli.  Among these six mutated genes was mutS, which encodes a component of the methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) system.  The majority of naturally occurring, strong mutators contain defects in the methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) system, with mutations in mutS predominating.  The picture of MutH-independent MMR in other bacteria is less clear, as MMR components other than MutS and MutL have not been identified in the majority of bacteria.  The methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) mechanism has been extensively studied in vitro and in vivo, but one of the difficulties in determining the biological relationships between the MMR-related proteins is the tendency of MutL to self-aggregate.  Among these six mutated genes was mutS, which encodes a component of the methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) system.  MutL is required to assist the mismatch repair protein MutS during initiation of the methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) response in various organisms ranging from prokaryotes to eukaryotes.  Moreover, methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) is known to trigger sensitivity to methylating agents via a mechanism that involves recognition by MutS of the O(6)-mG:T replication intermediates.  The system relies on the activity of two key proteins, MutS1 and MutL, which constitute a conserved core involved in mismatch recognition.  In Escherichia coli, the best studied mismatch repair (MMR) pathway is the methyl-directed long patch repair system which is mediated by three gene products; MutS, MutL and MutH.  Cells devoid of MutS1 or MutL proteins were as resistant to gamma-rays, mitomycin C and UV-irradiation as wild-type bacteria, suggesting that the mismatch repair system is not essential for the reconstitution of a functional genome after DNA damage.

"[SOC]###context: Here we observe that mutation rate, as reflected in recent evolutionary divergence and human nucleotide diversity, is markedly increased in later-replicating regions of the human genome ll classes of substitutions are affected, suggesting a generalized mechanism involving replication time-dependent DNA damage We show that mutation rate varies 6-fold across a single chromosome, that this variation is correlated with replication timing, and we propose a model to explain this variation that relies on the temporal separation of two processes for replicating past damaged DNA: error-free DNA damage tolerance and translesion synthesis.  Recent studies revealed a long suspected replication-timing effect on mutation rate, but the mechanisms that regulate the increase in mutation rate as the genome is replicated remain unclear.   DNA repair systems, in general, are less efficient in late replicating heterochromatic regions compared to early replicating euchromatic regions of the genome.  The mutational profile of the yeast genome is shaped by replication the mutation rate increases with the replication timing by more than 30% between the earliest and the latest replicating regions.  Thus, we show that the leading replicating strands present an excess of C over G and of A over T in the genome of S.  cerevisiae (reciprocally an excess of G + T over C + A in lagging strands) Late-replicating domains have higher divergence and diversity in Drosophila melanogaster Recent evidence also suggests that late replication is associated with high mutability in yeast.  Limited evidence from one chromosome arm in Drosophila melanogaster suggests the opposite pattern, with regions overlapping early-firing origins showing increased levels of diversity and divergence The mutation rate for DNA mismatch repair null strains was approximately 1 mutation per genome per generation, 225-fold greater than the wild-type rate.  The mutations were distributed randomly throughout the genome, independent of replication timing.  Many single-nucleotide substitutions in cancer genomes arise because of errors in DNA replication, which is spatio-temporally stratified.  Here we propose that DNA replication patterns help shape the mutational landscapes of normal and cancer genomes Using data on five fully sequenced cancer types and two personal genomes, we determined that the frequency of intergenic single-nucleotide substitution is significantly higher in late DNA replication timing regions, even after controlling for a number of genomic features we found that genomic regions in close spatial proximity to late-replicating domains display similar mutation spectra as the late-replicating regions themselves In addition, certain chromosome rearrangements found in cancer cells and in cells exposed to ionizing radiation display a significant delay in replication timing of >3 hours that affects the entire chromosome(2,3).  Recent work from our lab indicates that disruption of discrete cis-acting autosomal loci result in an extremely late replicating phenotype that affects the entire chromosome(4).  A conservative estimate is that at least 1-2% of new deleterious mutations affect some aspect of DNA replication, repair, or chromosome segregation.  Since deleterious mutations can have an effect even as heterozygotes, this mutation accumulation can create an inherited background of late-acting mutations that themselves enhance mutation rate.  Drake calculates that lytic RNA viruses display spontaneous mutation rates of approximately one per genome while most have mutation rates that are approximately 0. 1 per genome (Drake 1993).  This constancy of germline mutation rates among microbial species need not necessarily mean constancy of the somatic mutation rates.  A recent flurry of reports correlates replication timing (RT) with mutation rates during both evolution and cancer.  DNA replication timing, genome stability and cancer: late and/or delayed DNA replication timing is associated with increased genomic instability.  Since deleterious mutations can have an effect even as heterozygotes, this mutation accumulation can create an inherited background of late-acting mutations that themselves enhance mutation rate.  In addition, this method allows for the unambiguous identification of chromosomal rearrangements that correlate with changes in replication timing that affect the entire chromosome.

Here we show signal-binding motifs in PAR1&2 that are critical for breast cancer growth.  This occurs via the association of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain with Akt/PKB as a key signalling event of PARs.  Other PH-domain signal-proteins such as Etk/Bmx and Vav3 also associate with PAR1 and PAR2 through their PH domains.  PAR1 and PAR2 bind with priority to Etk/Bmx.  A point mutation in PAR2, H349A, but not in R352A, abrogates PH-protein association and is sufficient to markedly reduce PAR2-instigated breast tumour growth in vivo and placental extravillous trophoblast (EVT) invasion in vitro.

###question: PH motifs in which genes endow breast cancer growth?[EOC] [SOR]###response: Although emerging roles of protease-activated receptor1&2 (PAR1&2) in cancer are recognized, their underlying signalling events are poorly understood.  Signal-binding motifs in PAR1&2 are critical for breast cancer growth.  This occurs via the association of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain with Akt/PKB as a key signalling event of PARs.  Other PH-domain signal-proteins such as Etk/Bmx and Vav3 also associate with PAR1 and PAR2 through their PH domains.  PAR1 and PAR2 bind with priority to Etk/Bmx.  A point mutation in PAR2, H349A, but not in R352A, abrogates PH-protein association and is sufficient to markedly reduce PAR2-instigated breast tumour growth in vivo and placental extravillous trophoblast (EVT) invasion in vitro.  Similarly, the PAR1 mutant hPar1-7A, which is unable to bind the PH domain, reduces mammary tumours and EVT invasion, endowing these motifs with physiological significance and underscoring the importance of these previously unknown PAR1 and PAR2 PH-domain-binding motifs in both pathological and physiological invasion processes.

"[SOC]###context: Mutations in MED12 cause X-linked Ohdo syndrome In the two families, MED12 missense mutations (c. 3443G>A [p. Arg1148His] or c. 3493T>C [p. Ser1165Pro]) segregating with the phenotype were identified.  Upon subsequent analysis of an additional cohort of nine simplex male individuals with Ohdo syndrome, one additional de novo missense change (c. 5185C>A [p. His1729Asn]) in MED12 was detected.  The occurrence of three different hemizygous missense mutations in three unrelated families affected by Ohdo syndrome MKB type shows that mutations in MED12 are the underlying cause of this X-linked form of Ohdo syndrome.  FG syndrome, Lujan syndrome, and Ohdo syndrome, the Maat-Kievit-Brunner type, have been described as distinct syndromes with overlapping non-specific features and different missense mutations of the MED12 gene have been reported in all of them.  Parallel sequencing of all X-chromosome exons identified a frameshift mutation (c. 5898dupC) of MED12.  The severe degree of ID in male patients, as well as variable cognitive impairment in heterozygous females suggests that the duplication observed in the present family may have a more severe effect on MED12 function than missense mutations.  In a cognitively impaired male from this family, who also presented with tall stature and dysmorphism and did not have the MED12 mutation, a 600-kb duplication at 17p13. 3 including the YWHAE gene, was found in a mosaic state.   To date, these conditions include Opitz-Kaveggia (FG) syndrome, Lujan syndrome, Ohdo syndrome (Maat-Kievit-Brunner type, or OSMKB), and one large family with profound X-linked intellectual disability due to a novel c. 5898insC frameshift mutation that unlike the other three syndromes, resulted in affected female carriers and truncation of the MED12 protein.   This case lends credence to the evolving theory that the subtypes of Ohdo, and perhaps other MED12 disorders, reflect a spectrum of characteristics, rather than distinct syndromes.  MED12 [MIM *300188] (mediator complex subunit 12) mutations have been linked to numerous XLID syndromes, including Lujan, FG, and Ohdo, and MED12 is included in many XLID panels.  Finally, direct sequencing of MED12, the gene mutated in Opitz-Kaveggia syndrome, Lujan-Fryns syndrome and X-linked Ohdo syndrome identified in the two sibs the missense mutation c. 3443G>A (p.

"[SOC]###context: We recently showed that the dendritic protein neurogranin (Ng), including the endogenous Ng peptide 48 to 76 (Ng48-76), is markedly increased in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in AD and that Ng48-76 is the dominant peptide in human brain tissue.  In agreement with previous studies, we show that CSF Ng is significantly increased in AD as compared with healthy controls.   The results suggest that CSF Ng, in particular Ng48-76, might reflect the neurodegenerative processes within the brain, indicating a role for Ng as a potential novel clinical biomarker for synaptic function in AD.   These modifications were associated with impaired spatial memory and reduced hippocampal expression of signaling molecules important for synaptic plasticity and memory, including neurogranin, CaMKII, ERK, GSK3β, CREB, and expression of the transcription factor EGR1/Zif268.   Neurogranin in cerebrospinal fluid as a marker of synaptic degeneration in Alzheimer's disease.  Relative quantification revealed a significant increase of neurogranin in the AD group compared with controls, while the MCI group was not statistically different from either controls or the AD group.   The elevated neurogranin levels in the MCI and AD groups might reflect synaptic degeneration.  These results together suggest that cerebrospinal fluid neurogranin might be valuable together with the established AD biomarkers in the early diagnosis of AD and warrants further studies to determine the diagnostic value of neurogranin.  Further, to determine whether presynaptic or postsynaptic compartments of neurons are preferentially affected in AD patients, we studied 3 presynaptic vesicle proteins (synaptotagmin, synaptophysin, and Rab 3A), 2 synaptic membrane proteins (Gap 43 and synaptobrevin), and 2 postsynaptic proteins (neurogranin and synaptopodin) in specimens from AD and age-matched control brains.   Our study suggests that postsynaptic proteins and presynaptic proteins are important for synaptic function and may be related to cognitive impairments in AD.

"[SOC]###context: Finally, five promising differentially miRNAs (miR-200a, miR-100, miR-141, miR-200b, and miR-200c) were reported with the consistent direction in four or more studies.  MiR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, and miR-141, all of them belong to miR-200 family, were reported with consistently up-regulated in at least 4 studies, whereas miR-100 was reported with down-regulated in 4 studies Upregulation of microRNA-203 is associated with advanced tumor progression and poor prognosis in epithelial ovarian cancer multivariate analysis showed that the status of miR-203 expression was an independent predictor for both overall survival and progression-free survival in EOC.  These findings provide the convincing evidence for the first time that the upregulation of miR-203 may serve as a novel molecular marker to predict the aggressive tumor progression and unfavorable prognosis of EOC patients Some, but not all, of the data indicated that the miR-200 family was dysregulated in a variety of malignancies.  In this study, we demonstrated that miR-200a and E-cadherin were significantly upregulated in EOC compared to benign epithelial ovarian cysts and normal ovarian tissues There was a significantly positive correlation between miR-200a and E-cadherin in EOC.  The biphasic expression pattern suggested that miR-200a levels may serve as novel biomarkers for the early detection of EOC, and miR-200a and E-cadherin are candidate targets for the development of new treatment modalities against ovarian cancer Kaplan-Meier analysis showed low miR-510 expression, low miR-509-5p expression, and advanced FIGO stage, and chemotherapy resistance were significantly associated with poorer overall survival (P < 0. 05).  Our results suggest that miRNAs may play a role in the progression of OSC, and miR-510 and miR-509-5p may be considered novel-candidate clinical biomarkers for predicting OSC outcome The qRT-PCR results showed that miR-510, miR-509-5p, and miR-508-3p were significantly downregulated and that miR-483-5p was upregulated in stage III OSC compared with stage I, which was consistent with the microarray results In this study, we examined serum miR-21 levels in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients, and explored its association with clinicopathological factors and prognosis.  The results showed significantly higher serum miR-21 levels in EOC patients than in healthy controls.  In addition, increased serum miR-21 expression was correlated with advanced FIGO stage, high tumor grade, and shortened overall survival.  These findings indicate that serum miR-21 may serve as a novel diagnostic and prognostic marker, and be used as a therapeutic target for the treatment of EOC Identification of serum microRNA-21 as a biomarker for early detection and prognosis in human epithelial ovarian cancer Serum miR-132, miR-26a, let-7b, and miR-145 could be considered as potential candidates as novel biomarkers in serous ovarian cancer.  Among the miRNAs that showed a consistent regulation tendency through all specimens and showed more than a 2-fold difference in serum, 5 miRNAs (miR-132, miR-26a, let-7b, miR-145, and miR-143) were determined as the 5 most markedly down-regulated miRNAs in the serum from ovarian cancer patients with respect to those of controls.  Four miRNAs (miR-132, miR-26a, let-7b, and miR-145) out of 5 selected miRNAs were significantly underexpressed in the serum of ovarian cancer patients in qRT-PCR  microRNA (miR)-182, miR-200a, miR-200b and miR-200c were highly overexpressed in the SEOC cell lines relative to normal human ovarian surface epithelial cells and were assessed in RNA extracted from serum as candidate biomarkers Together, these results suggest that low miR-100 expression             may be an independent poor prognostic factor and miR-100 can function as a tumor             suppressor by targeting PLK1 in human EOCs Prognostic implications of microRNA-100 and its functional roles in             human epithelial ovarian cancer Taken together, miR-152 and miR-148a may be involved             in the carcinogenesis of ovarian cancer through deregulation of cell proliferation.              They may be novel biomarkers for early detection or therapeutic targets of ovarian             cancer MicroRNA let-7a: a potential marker for selection of paclitaxel in ovarian cancer management  The study suggests that the beneficial impact of the addition of paclitaxel on EOC survival was significantly linked to let-7a levels, and that miRNAs such as let-7a may be a useful marker for selection of chemotherapeutic agents in EOC management miR-200c has potential as a predictor of survival, and is a biomarker of relapse, in stage I EOC MicroRNA microarray identifies Let-7i as a novel biomarker and therapeutic target in human epithelial ovarian cancer  our results strongly suggest that let-7i might be used as a therapeutic target to modulate platinum-based chemotherapy and as a biomarker to predict chemotherapy response and survival in patients with ovarian cancer miRNAs-21, 92 and 93 are known oncogenes with therapeutic and biomarker potential Serum miR-132, miR-26a, let-7b, and miR-145 could be considered as potential candidates as novel biomarkers in serous ovarian cancer

"[SOC]###context: geck: trio-based comparative benchmarking of variant calls.  Classical methods of comparing the accuracies of variant calling pipelines are based on truth sets of variants whose genotypes are previously determined with high confidence.  An alternative way of performing benchmarking is based on Mendelian constraints between related individuals.  Statistical analysis of Mendelian violations can provide truth set-independent benchmarking information, and enable benchmarking less-studied variants and diverse populations. Results: We introduce a statistical mixture model for comparing two variant calling pipelines from genotype data they produce after running on individual members of a trio.  We determine the accuracy of our model by comparing the precision and recall of GATK Unified Genotyper and Haplotype Caller on the high-confidence SNPs of the NIST Ashkenazim trio and the two independent Platinum Genome trios.  We show that our method is able to estimate differential precision and recall between the two pipelines with 10-3 uncertainty.

The 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative JTV519, and the more specific derivative S107 (2,3,4,5,-tetrahydro-7-methoxy-4-methyl-1,4-benzothiazepine), are thought to improve skeletal muscle function by stabilizing the RyR1-FKBP12 complex.  In this article, we synthesize derivatives of the channel activator 4-chloro-3-methyl phenol (4-CmC) and the 1,4-benzothiazepine channel inhibitor 4-[-3{1-(4-benzyl) piperidinyl}propionyl]-7-methoxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,4-benzothiazepine (K201, JTV519) with enhanced electron donor properties.

"[SOC]###context: Escherichia coli rnhA mutants devoid of RNase HI exhibit constitutive stable DNA replication, cSDR, which is thought to be initiated from R-loops stabilized in the absence of RNase HI.  We propose that the organized structure of the R-loop is critical for primer RNA function in vivo with important implications for the RNA processing and DNA replication machinery.  The precursor primer RNA exists as a persistent RNA-DNA hybrid, known as an R-loop, formed during transcription through the replication origin (Xu, B. , and Clayton, D.  A.  (1996) EMBO J.  15, 3135-3143).  We found that overproduction of RecG protein drastically decreased copy numbers of ColE1-type plasmids, which require R-loop formation between the template DNA and a primer RNA transcript (RNA II) for the initiation of replication.  These results suggest that overproduced RecG inhibits the initiation of replication by prematurely resolving the R-loops formed at the replication origin region of these plasmids with its unique helicase activity.  The possibility that RecG regulates the initiation of a unique mode of DNA replication, oriC-independent constitutive stable DNA replication, by its activity in resolving R-loops is discussed.  We propose that downstream of a replication block, RNA at R-loops is extended by DNA polymerase I, opening up the DNA duplex and leading to the recruitment of the replisome.  This would allow replication to proceed while the original block is repaired or bypassed Furthermore, increased RNaseH expression significantly alleviated genomic instability in deficient fibroblasts suggesting that cotranscriptional R-loops formation contributes to the genesis of replication-dependent DSBs in these cells.  Transcription is an important source of replicative stress and consequently, maintenance of genome integrity requires the protection of chromosomes from the deleterious effects arising from the interaction between nascent RNAs and template DNA, leading to stable DNA-RNA hybrids (R-loop) formation.  Strikingly, we found that attenuation of replication strongly suppresses R-loop-mediated DNA rearrangements in both E.  coli and HeLa cells.  More importantly, we then show that R-loop formation causes DNA replication fork stalling, and that this in fact underlies the effects of R loops on genomic stabilit R-loop-mediated genomic instability is caused by impairment of replication fork progression When any of these processes are not properly coordinated, aberrant outcomes such as fork reversal and R-loop formation arise and trigger unscheduled recombinogenic events and genome rearrangements.   Many studies show that cells can manage R loop formation with efficiency, and can also process the R-loops already formed in the cell, and by which, the bad effects of R-loops on DNA replication, gene mutation and homologous recombination can be regulated.  Here we propose that physiological R-loop formation at CpG island promoters can contribute to DNA replication origin specification at these regions, the most efficient replication initiation sites in mammalian cells.   In agreement with this, we found that R-loops co-localize with the ORC within the same CpG island region in a significant fraction of these efficient replication origins, precisely at the position displaying the highest density of G4 motifs.   connection between transcription and replication in human cells and suggests that R-loop dysregulation at CpG island promoter-origins might contribute to the phenotype of DNA replication abnormalities and loss of genome integrity detected in cancer cells.  We show that RNA:DNA hybrids (R-loops) form at sites of transcription/replication collisions and that RNase H1 functions to suppress CFS instability.  R-loops and initiation of DNA replication in human cells: a missing link? Stable RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) prime the initiation of replication in Escherichia coli cells.  We propose that downstream of a replication block, RNA at R-loops is extended by DNA polymerase I, opening up the DNA duplex and leading to the recruitment of the replisome.  Immediately after infection, RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) occur on (at least some) replication origins, with the annealed RNA serving as a primer for leading-strand synthesis in one direction.  Here we propose that physiological R-loop formation at CpG island promoters can contribute to DNA replication origin specification at these regions, the most efficient replication initiation sites in mammalian cells.  ColE1 plasmid origins of replication and oriK sites initiate primosome assembly by an RNA-DNA hybrid structure known as R-loop.  This scenario builds on the connection between transcription and replication in human cells and suggests that R-loop dysregulation at CpG island promoter-origins might contribute to the phenotype of DNA replication abnormalities and loss of genome integrity detected in cancer cells.  The multiple cleavage sites on the R-loop substrate match the priming sites observed in vivo, suggesting that RNase MRP alone is capable of generating virtually all of the leading-strand replication primers.  Mechanisms of primer RNA synthesis and D-loop/R-loop-dependent DNA replication in Escherichia coli.  Alternative oriC-independent modes of replication initiation are possible, one of which is constitutive stable DNA replication (cSDR) from transcription-associated RNA-DNA hybrids or R-loops.  Our results suggest that Top1 execute this function by suppressing the formation of DNA-RNA hybrids during transcription, these so-called R-loops interfering with the progression of replication forks.  Critical role of R-loops in processing replication blocks.  The possibility that RecG regulates the initiation of a unique mode of DNA replication, oriC-independent constitutive stable DNA replication, by its activity in resolving R-loops is discussed.  Competition between the RNA transcript and the nontemplate DNA strand during R-loop formation in vitro: a nick can serve as a strong R-loop initiation site.  More importantly, we then show that R-loop formation causes DNA replication fork stalling, and that this in fact underlies the effects of R loops on genomic stability.   Consistent with this hypothesis, the 3' ends of the mitochondrial R-loop formed by in vitro transcription are located close to the initiation sites of the mitochondrial DNA replication.   A hybrid G-quadruplex structure formed between RNA and DNA explains the extraordinary stability of the mitochondrial R-loop.  Previous studies have shown that the newly synthesized primers form a stable and persistent RNA-DNA hybrid, a R-loop, near the leading-strand origin of DNA replication.   Escherichia coli rnhA mutants devoid of RNase HI exhibit constitutive stable DNA replication, cSDR, which is thought to be initiated from R-loops stabilized in the absence of RNase HI.

"[SOC]###context: Importantly, ceftriaxone is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.   Ceftriaxone delays loss of neurons in genetic animal models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis through upregulation of astrocytic glutamate transporter expression (GLT-1).  OBJECTIVES: Ceftriaxone increases expression of the astrocytic glutamate transporter, EAAT2, which might protect from glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity.   Thirty-four compounds (including riluzole, ceftriaxone, minocyclin, PBA, lithium, acetylcysteine) in human and mouse ALS trials and an additional set of 1040 FDA-approved compounds also showed no effect on SOD1 promoter activity.   Two of these patients received ceftriaxone for 1 month without clinical improvement.  In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, down-regulation of the astrocyte-specific glutamate excitatory amino acid transporter 2 is hypothesized to increase extracellular glutamate, thereby leading to excitotoxic motor neuron death.  The antibiotic ceftriaxone was recently reported to induce excitatory amino acid transporter 2 and to prolong the survival of mutant superoxide dismutase 1 transgenic mice.  OBJECTIVE: Ceftriaxone has been reported to reduce neuronal damage in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and in an in-vitro model of neuronal ischaemia through increased expression and activity of the glutamate transporter, GLT1.   Dysfunction of EAAT2 is implicated in acute and chronic neurological disorders, including stroke/ischemia, temporal lobe epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, human immunodeficiency virus 1-associated dementia, and growth of malignant gliomas.  Ceftriaxone, one of the beta-lactam antibiotics, is a stimulator of EAAT2 expression with neuroprotective effects in both in vitro and in vivo models based in part on its ability to inhibit neuronal cell death by glutamate excitotoxicity.   Motor neuron disease recovery associated with IV ceftriaxone and anti-Babesia therapy.  This report summarizes what we believe to be the first verifiable case of a significant and progressive motor neuron disease (MND) consistent with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis that resolved during treatment with i. v.  ceftriaxone plus oral atovaquone and mefloquine.  Other agents (ceftriaxone, minocycline, ONO-2506, and IGF-1 polypeptide) are already in phase III trials involving large numbers of patients with ALS.  Ongoing trials are exploring the value of antiglutamatergic agents, including the cephalosporin antibiotic ceftriaxone, as well as antioxidants, mitochondrial enhancers and anti-apoptotic drugs.   Recently, Rothstein et al.  reported that beta-lactam antibiotics, including penicillin and ceftriaxone, are potential therapeutic drugs to treat some neurological disorders, e. g. , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), by modulating the expression of glutamate transporter GLT1 via gene activation.   Ceftriaxone was neuroprotective in vitro when used in models of ischaemic injury and motor neuron degeneration, both based in part on glutamate toxicity.  When used in an animal model of the fatal disease ALS, the drug delayed loss of neurons and muscle strength, and increased mouse survival.   We describe two patients with lateral amyotrophic sclerosis who, after informed consent, received empirical treatment with intravenous cephtriaxone at a dose of 2 g/24 hours for three weeks, with no positive results.  Despite promising stage 2 data, stage 3 of this trial of ceftriaxone in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis did not show clinical efficacy.   Importantly, ceftriaxone is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  The cephalosporin antibiotic ceftriaxone was evaluated as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). 
###question: What is known about clinical efficacy of ceftriaxone for treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis?[EOC] [SOR]###response: There have been a few case reports to suggest that ceftriaxone can be effective for treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  However, other case reports did not report clinical benefit of ceftriaxone therapy for ALS.  Ceftriaxone has been reported to reduce neuronal damage in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis a through increased expression and activity of the glutamate transporter, GLT1.  Clinical trials investigating potential clinical benefits of ceftriaxone in ALS are ongoing. [EOR]"

"[SOC]###context: The type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1) is a critical negative regulator of Ca(2+) cycling and contractility in the cardiomyocyte.  In particular, it mediates restoration of cardiac function to basal levels, after beta-adrenergic stimulation, by dephosphorylating key phospho-proteins.  PP1 is a holoenzyme comprised of its catalytic and auxiliary subunits.  These regulatory proteins dictate PP1's subcellular localization, substrate specificity and activity.  Amongst them, inhibitor-1 is of particular importance since it has been implicated as an integrator of multiple neurohormonal pathways, which finely regulate PP1 activity, at the level of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR).  In fact, perturbations in the regulation of PP1 by inhibitor-1 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure, suggesting that inhibitor-1-based therapeutic interventions may ameliorate cardiac dysfunction and remodeling in the failing heart.   Aberrant beta-adrenergic signaling and depressed calcium homeostasis, associated with an imbalance of protein kinase A and phosphatase-1 activities, are hallmarks of heart failure.  Phosphatase-1 is restrained by its endogenous inhibitor, protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 (PPI-1) Using this technology, we showed that inhibition of the protein phosphatase 1, by its constitutively active inhibitor-1, significantly increases cardiac contractility and calcium handling.   Thus, long-term cardiac specific overexpression of the protein phosphatase 1 inhibitor-1 and the associated increases in cardiac contractility appear to herald changes in a rather small number of proteins, which may reflect important compensatory adaptations in a hyperdynamic heart [corrected] Inhibitor-1 becomes a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 when phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase at Thr(35).  Moreover, Ser(67) of inhibitor-1 serves as a substrate for cyclin-dependent kinase 5 in the brain.  Inhibitor 1 (I-1) is a protein inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), a major eukaryotic Ser/Thr phosphatase.  Nonphosphorylated I-1 is inactive, whereas phosphorylated I-1 is a potent PP1 inhibitor.   Ser67-phosphorylated inhibitor 1 is a potent protein phosphatase 1 inhibitor.  PP1 activity was inhibited by protamine, heparin, okadaic acid (IC50 50 nM) and mammalian inhibitor-1 (IC50 2 nM).  On the other hand.   The cDNA encoding human brain protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 (I-1) was expressed in Escherichia coli.  Following PKA phosphorylation at a threonine, recombinant human I-1 was indistinguishable from rabbit skeletal muscle I-1 as a potent and specific inhibitor of the type-1 protein serine/threonine phosphatase (PP1).  N-Terminal phosphopeptides of I-1 that retained the selectivity of intact human I-1 highlighted a functional domain that mediates PP1 inhibition.  Protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 was purified from bovine adipose tissue.  The protein had an apparent molecular mass of 32 kDa by SDS/PAGE and a Stokes' radius of 3. 4 nm.  It was phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase on a threonyl residue; this phosphorylation was necessary for inhibition of protein phosphatase-1.  Bovine adipose tissue inhibitor-1 was compared directly with rabbit skeletal muscle inhibitor-1 and with a 32000-Mr, dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein from bovine brain (DARPP-32), also an inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1.

Possible association of human leucocyte antigen DR1 with delayed sleep phase syndrome.  The study investigated the human leucocyte antigen (HLA), types A, B and DR, of 42 patients with delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS) and compared the frequencies of the antigens with those in 117 healthy controls.  The comparison revealed that the gene frequencies and positivities of HLA-A, -B and -DR, except for DR1, had no significant differences between the patients and controls.  The frequency of HLA-DR1 was increased in the DSPS patients as compared with that in the healthy controls (P = 0. 0069 in positivity).  In human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing, the incidence of DR1 positivity alone was significantly higher in DSPS patients than in healthy subjects.   Recent progress in biological clock research has facilitated genetic analysis of circadian rhythm sleep disorders, such as delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS) and non-24-h sleep-wake syndrome (N-24) Association of structural polymorphisms in the human period3 gene with delayed sleep phase syndrome.  One of the haplotypes was significantly associated with DSPS (Bonferroni's corrected P = 0. 037; odds ratio = 7. 79; 95% CI 1. 59-38. 3) in our study population.  Our results suggest that structural polymorphisms in the hPer3 gene may be implicated in the pathogenesis of DSPS.  A length polymorphism in the circadian clock gene Per3 is linked to delayed sleep phase syndrome and extreme diurnal preference.  Polymorphisms in the CLOCK, BMAL1, Per3 and TIMELESS genes have been associated with susceptibility to mood disorder, and single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotypes in several circadian genes have been observed among those displaying certain circadian phenotypes, including worse mood in the evening, insomnia in mania and early, middle or late insomnia in depression.   To investigate the link between extreme diurnal preference, delayed sleep phase syndrome, and a length polymorphism in Per3 The Per3 polymorphism correlated significantly with extreme diurnal preference, the longer allele associating with morningness and the shorter allele with eveningness.  The shorter allele was strongly associated with the delayed sleep phase syndrome patients, 75% of whom were homozygous.  We studied the association between the AA-NAT gene and delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS).  Results indicate that there is a significant difference in allele positivity at the single nucleotide polymorphism involved in an amino acid substitution from alanine to threonine at position 129 between patients with DSPS and healthy controls.  The frequency of the 129 threonine allele is significantly higher in the patients than in the controls ( P=0. 0029).  The data suggest that AA-NAT could be a susceptibility gene for DSPS.  Our results suggest that latitude has a role in the influence of hPer3 gene polymorphism on delayed sleep-phase syndrome and confirm previous data showing its association with morningness-eveningness tendencies.  Association of the length polymorphism in the human Per3 gene with the delayed sleep-phase syndrome: does latitude have an influence upon it?

The primary structural component of Lewy bodies are fibrils composed primarily of alpha-synuclein, a highly conserved 140 amino acid protein that is predominantly expressed in neurons and which may play a role in synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission.  Fibrillar α-synuclein (AS) is the major component of Lewy bodies, the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease.   Alpha-synuclein (alphaS) is the primary component of Lewy bodies, the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's Disease.   For alpha-synuclein, the major protein component of Lewy bodies associated with Parkinson's disease, we have used a combination of ssNMR and biochemical data to identify the key region for self-aggregation of the protein as residues 77-82 (VAQKTV).   The protein alpha-synuclein (AS) is the primary fibrillar component of Lewy bodies, the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease.   Recently, the presynaptic protein alpha-synuclein was shown to be a major component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites.

The segregation of alpha-synuclein to Lewy body peripheral domain is consistent with the hypothesis that alpha-synuclein is continually deposited onto Lewy bodies.  Identification of protein interfaces between α-synuclein, the principal component of Lewy bodies in Parkinson disease, and the molecular chaperones human Hsc70 and the yeast Ssa1p Whereas approximately 550 proteins were identified in the LB-enriched sample by mass spectrometry, quantitative comparison with the control sample revealed that approximately 40 proteins were co-enriched with alpha-synuclein, the major component in Lewy bodies This apparent conflict in protein levels might have arisen from examining Lewy body disease cases with coexisting Alzheimer-type pathologies. To assess whether ATP13A2 levels in Lewy body disease are modified by Alzheimer-type β-amyloid deposition, we evaluated cases of pure PD and pure dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) for changes in ATP13A2, α-synuclein and β-amyloid protein levels in cortical regions with and without Lewy bodies. In all Lewy body disease cases, we identified decreased ATP13A2 protein levels that correlated with increases in both α-synuclein and β-amyloid Partial colocalization was observed between ATP13A2 and α-synuclein in Lewy bodies, whereas ATP13A2 did not colocalize with pathological β-amyloid deposition. Our data show that patients with Lewy body diseases have an overall deficit in ATP13A2 protein levels, with the remaining protein being more insoluble and partially redistributing towards Lewy bodies Identification of protein interfaces between α-synuclein, the principal component of Lewy bodies in Parkinson disease, and the molecular chaperones human Hsc70 and the yeast Ssa1p.

Lewy bodies comprise of aggregated intracellular vesicles and proteins and α-synuclein is reported to be a major protein component.

These findings indicate that alpha-synuclein forms the major filamentous component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. .

This paper aims to distinguish between normal and pathological speech, more specifically between apraxia of speech and spastic dysarthria Long-term phonatory instability in ataxic dysarthria.  The objective of this study is to evaluate phonation in ataxic dysarthria and a control group of normal speakers Dysprosody is a common feature in speakers with hypokinetic dysarthria.  The prosodic profile of Cantonese speakers with hypokinetic dysarthria is similar to those of other languages (for example, English).  Classification of dysarthria types comprises flaccid, spastic, ataxic, hypo- and hyperkinetic and mixed dysarthria.  Dysarthria affects linguistic domains such as respiration, phonation, articulation, resonance and prosody due to upper motor neuron, lower motor neuron, cerebellar or extrapyramidal tract lesions.  The dysarthria types were spastic (15 subjects), flaccid (10), mixed (12), hypokinetic (12), hyperkinetic (9) and ataxic (8).  Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder which can be classified according to the underlying neuropathology and is associated with disturbances of respiration, laryngeal function, airflow direction, and articulation resulting in difficulties of speech quality and intelligibility.  There are six major types of dysarthria: flaccid dysarthria associated with lower motor neuron impairment, spastic dysarthria associated with damaged upper motor neurons linked to the motor areas of the cerebral cortex, ataxic dysarthria primarily caused by cerebellar dysfunction, and hyperkinetic dysarthria and hypokinetic dysarthria, which are related to a disorder of the extrapyramidal system.

Motor neuron disease encompasses a group of terminal, demyelinating diseases affecting upper- and lower-motor neurons and producing muscular weakness resulting in a flaccid, spastic, or spastic-flaccid dysarthria of speech.  Dysarthria is a frequently occurring motor speech disorder which can be caused by neurological trauma, cerebral palsy, or degenerative neurological diseases.  Dysarthria is a motor disorder of speech characterized by abnormalities of the articulation and intelligibility of speech.  There are six major types of dysarthria: flaccid dysarthria associated with lower motor neuron impairment, spastic dysarthria associated with damaged upper motor neurons linked to the motor areas of the cerebral cortex, ataxic dysarthria primarily caused by cerebellar dysfunction, and hyperkinetic dysarthria and hypokinetic dysarthria, which are related to a disorder of the extrapyramidal system

"[SOC]###context: Our results indicate that this simplified one-shot proteomics approach with long monolithic columns is advantageous for rapid, deep, sensitive, and reproducible proteome analysis.  Rapid and deep profiling of human induced pluripotent stem cell proteome by one-shot NanoLC-MS/MS analysis with meter-scale monolithic silica columns.  Here, we describe an in-house built ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) system, with little complexity in design and high separation power combined with convenience in operation With the longest gradient we identified over 4500 protein groups and more than 26,000 unique peptides from 1 μg of a human cancer cell lysate in a single run using an Orbitrap Velos - a level of performance often seen solely using multidimensional separation strategies Our data demonstrate that the combination of UHPLC with high resolution mass spectrometry at increased sequencing speeds enables extensive proteome analysis in single runs.  The experimental results showed that the numbers of identified peptides and proteins were maximized and reached a plateau with a gradient time of several tens of hours, which indicated that our model to optimize one dimensional HPLC conditions with a long column could be verified and useful.  In this study, we combined well-approved techniques, namely elevated chromatographic temperatures, long RP columns and the multidimensional protein identification technology MudPIT to achieve high proteome coverage.  Also, a high identification rate for the challenging integral membrane proteins was achieved.

"[SOC]###context: Prader-Willi syndrome is a complex genetic disease caused by lack of expression of paternally inherited genes on chromosome 15q11-q13.  Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is caused by the disturbed expression of genes from the imprinted region of 15q11-q13, but the specific contributions of individual genes remain unknown.  Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare disorder caused by genetic defects in certain regions of chromosome 15q11-13.  Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is an example of a human genetic disorder that involves imprinting genes on the proximal long arm of chromosome 15 and SNRPN gene as a candidate gene for this syndrome.  Genomic imprinting plays an important role in the molecular pathogenesis of PWS that caused by paternal microdeletions of 15q11-q13 or maternal UPD of chromosome 15.  The basic defect seemed to be an absence of function of PWS genes that are normally expressed only from the paternal chromosome 15.  Abnormalities in imprinted inheritance occur in several genetic diseases and cancer, and are exemplified by the diverse genetic defects involving chromosome 15q11-q13 in Prader-Willi (PWS) and Angelman (AS) syndromes.  The predominant genetic defects in PW are 15q11-13 deletions of paternal origin and maternal chromosome 15 uniparental disomy.  In both disorders, these mutations are associated with parent-of-origin specific methylation at several 15q11-13 loci.  Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is caused by absence of a paternal contribution of the chromosome region 15q11-q13, resulting from paternal deletions, maternal uniparental disomy, or rare imprinting mutations.  Because methylation analysis can detect all three major classes of genetic defects associated with PWS (deletion, UPD, or imprinting mutations), methylation analysis with either PW71 or SNRPN is an efficient primary screening test to rule out a diagnosis of PWS.  The predominant genetic defects in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) are 15q11-q13 deletions of paternal origin and maternal chromosome 15 uniparental disomy (UPD).  In both disorders, these mutations are associated with parent-of-origin specific methylation at several 15q11-q13 loci.  The critical PWS region has been narrowed to a approximately 320-kb region between D15S63 and D15S174, encoding several imprinted transcripts, including PAR5, IPW, PAR1 (refs 7,8) and SNRPN, which has so far been considered a strong candidate for the PWS gene.  The genetic defects in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) map to 15q11-13. 
###question: Which genetic defects are observed in Prader-Willi syndrome?[EOC] [SOR]###response: The predominant genetic defects in Prader-Willi syndrome are 15q11-13 deletions of paternal origin and maternal chromosome 15 uniparental disomy, or rare imprinting mutations, combined with monoallelic expression of the paternal alleles.

"[SOC]###context: Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most common mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal tract.  Surgery remains the elective treatment.  We retrospectively compared two group of patients, who underwent surgery for GIST before and after Imatinib advent in order to analyze the recurrence and survival rate.  Adjuvant imatinib 400 mg/day for 3 years duration is a standard treatment in all patients with significant risk of recurrence following resection of primary GISTs R1 surgery (versus R0) alone is not an indication for adjuvant imatinib in low-risk GIST.  Treatment is not recommended in an imatinib-insensitive D842V-mutated GIST Prognostic factors such as tumor size, mitotic rate and presence of metastases may provide an indication for adjuvant imatinib mesylate (IM) treatment.  Here we present a young patient with a large GIST with high-risk features who is in complete remission after surgical excision and adjuvant IM treatment.  This patient is the only colon-located CD117-positive case where IM was administered.  Imatinib mesylate is the sole BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved as first-line treatment of accelerated-phase (AP) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).  imatinib mesylate could be a therapeutic target of strategies against osteosarcoma tumors.  Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is well-established as a potentially curative treatment for patients who have chronic myeloid leukemia.  The success of imatinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) as initial therapy has changed the treatment paradigm for this disease.  Imatinib plus hydroxyurea is well tolerated among patients with meningioma but has modest anti-tumor activity for this indication.  Ki67 correlated with time to recurrence (p=0. 022).  Ki67 >11% was taken as the indication to start imatinib chemotherapy (sensitivity 61. 5%, specificity 92. 0%, p=0. 022).  Significant pharmacokinetic interactions have already been shown between St.  John's Wort (SJW) and the anticancer drugs imatinib and irinotecan.  for CML we analysed imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib.  Imatinib mesylate, an orally administered kinase inhibitor that targets the Kit (CD117) protein, currently has 10 approved indications including treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).  The drugs were assessed according to clinical evidence on efficacy and safety, based on Micromedex categorization, on systematic reviews and meta-analyses.  Indications present in the legal documentation were compared to the indications approved by regulatory agencies.  RESULTS: Bevacizumab, capecitabine, cetuximab, erlotinib, rituximab, imatinib, and temozolomide Bcr-Abl, an oncogene responsible for CML Bcr-Abl-expressing cells showed resistance to death activated by spindle defects, reversed by imatinib.  Imatinib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is first-line treatment in patients with metastatic or unresectable GIST.  Surgical indication for metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) treated with imatinib is not yet established.  Surgery of residual disease upon best clinical response seems associated with survival benefit compared with historical controls in similar patient collectives treated with imatinib alone.  To explore the effect of preoperative imatinib mesylate (IM) in patients with unresectable or locally advanced primary gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) The patient had been diagnosed 14 months earlier and had been submitted to surgery, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and temozolomide-based chemotherapy.  On clinical suspicion of recurrence 5 months later, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a lesion at the site of preceded surgery, which was treated by imatinib mesylate Radical surgery remains the most effective method of GIST treatment.  In inoperable/metastatic lesion the treatment of choice is tyrosinase kinase inhibitor--imatinib.  Imatinib mesylate (STI571), a specific Bcr-Abl inhibitor, has shown a potent antileukemic activity in clinical studies of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients.  Imatinib, an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of c-kit, was used as an adjuvant chemotherapy in two patients who underwent curative surgery for recurrent gastrointestinal stromal tumors.  Adjuvant imatinib 400 mg/day for 3 years duration is a standard treatment in all patients with significant risk of recurrence following resection of primary GISTs.

"[SOC]###context: LARVA: an integrative framework for large-scale analysis of recurrent variants in noncoding annotations.  In cancer research, background models for mutation rates have been extensively calibrated in coding regions, leading to the identification of many driver genes, recurrently mutated more than expected.  Noncoding regions are also associated with disease; however, background models for them have not been investigated in as much detail.  This is partially due to limited noncoding functional annotation.  Also, great mutation heterogeneity and potential correlations between neighboring sites give rise to substantial overdispersion in mutation count, resulting in problematic background rate estimation.  Here, we address these issues with a new computational framework called LARVA.  It integrates variants with a comprehensive set of noncoding functional elements, modeling the mutation counts of the elements with a β-binomial distribution to handle overdispersion.  LARVA, moreover, uses regional genomic features such as replication timing to better estimate local mutation rates and mutational hotspots.  We demonstrate LARVA's effectiveness on 760 whole-genome tumor sequences, showing that it identifies well-known noncoding drivers, such as mutations in the TERT promoter.  Furthermore, LARVA highlights several novel highly mutated regulatory sites that could potentially be noncoding drivers.  We make LARVA available as a software tool and release our highly mutated annotations as an online resource (larva. gersteinlab. org).

"[SOC]###context: The C terminus of the histone chaperone Asf1 cross-links to histone H3 in yeast and promotes interaction with histones H3 and H4.  The central histone H3/H4 chaperone Asf1 comprises a highly conserved globular core and a divergent C-terminal tail.   The histone H3-H4 chaperone Asf1 is involved in chromatin assembly (or disassembly), histone exchange, regulation of transcription, and chromatin silencing in several organisms.   An ASF1-EGFP fusion protein localizes to the nucleus.  By tandem-affinity purification/mass spectrometry as well as yeast two-hybrid analysis, we identified histones H3 and H4 as ASF1 interaction partners.    This inhibition requires Asf1 binding to H3-H4 and Rtt109 KAT activity, but not tail acetylation of H3-H4 or K56 acetylation of H3.   Asf1 is a conserved histone H3/H4 chaperone that can assemble and disassemble nucleosomes and promote histone acetylation.   Here we characterize further interactions between budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) Asf1 and Set2 using assays of intragenic transcription, H3/H4 posttranslational modification, coding region cross-linking of Asf1 and Set2, and cooccurrence of Asf1 and Set2 in protein complexes.   Consistent with this possibility, we show that Asf1 stimulates Set2 occupancy of the coding region of a highly transcribed gene by a mechanism that depends on Asf1 binding to H3/H4.   Drosophila histones H3 and H4 can also be produced as a soluble (H3H4)(2) heterotetrameric complex if they are co-expressed with the histone chaperone Asf1.  Structure and function of the histone chaperone CIA/ASF1 complexed with histones H3 and H4.  Newly synthesized histones H3-H4 first bind histone chaperone Asf1 and are then transferred to other chaperones for nucleosome assembly The C terminus of the histone chaperone Asf1 cross-links to histone H3 in yeast and promotes interaction with histones H3 and H4 Histone chaperone Asf1 is required for histone H3 lysine 56 acetylation, a modification associated with S phase in mitosis and meiosis Antisilencing function 1 (ASF1) is a major histone H3-H4 chaperone that deposits histones H3 and H4 onto DNA Rtt109, a recently discovered histone acetyltransferase (HAT) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, functions with the histone chaperone Asf1 to acetylate lysine K56 on histone H3 (H3K56), a modification associated with newly synthesized histones In this issue of Cell, English et al.  present the first crystal structure of a histone chaperone (Asf1) bound to histones (the H3/H4 heterodimer) By tandem-affinity purification/mass spectrometry as well as yeast two-hybrid analysis, we identified histones H3 and H4 as ASF1 interaction partners.  Anti-silencing function 1 (Asf1) is a highly conserved chaperone of histones H3/H4 that assembles or disassembles chromatin during transcription, replication, and repair.  Analysis of a panel of Asf1 mutations that modulate the ability of Asf1 to bind to histones H3/H4 demonstrates that the histone binding activity of Asf1 is required for the acetylation of Lys-9 and Lys-56 on newly synthesized H3.  Thus Rad53 competes with histones H3-H4 and cochaperones HirA/CAF-I for binding to Asf1.  Structure and function of the histone chaperone CIA/ASF1 complexed with histones H3 and H4.  Currently, the best-characterized chaperone-histone interaction is that between the ubiquitous chaperone Asf1 and a dimer of H3 and H4.

"[SOC]###context: ILK knockdown had no effect on the viability or survival pathway activity pattern of MM cells.  We conclude that ILK does not play a prominent role in the promotion or sustenance of established MM.  Defective granulation tissue formation in mice with specific ablation of integrin-linked kinase in fibroblasts Here, we show that fibroblast-restricted inactivation of ILK in mice leads to impaired healing due to a severe reduction in the number of myofibroblasts, whereas inflammatory infiltrate and vascularization of the granulation tissue are unaffected.  in fibroblasts, ILK is crucial for limiting RhoA activity, thus promoting TGFβ1 production, which is essential for dermal repair following injury.  Our results show that ILK is important for the function, but not the differentiation, of osteoclasts.  Osteoclast-specific inactivation of the integrin-linked kinase (ILK) inhibits bone resorption.  ack of ILK in the hepatocytes imparts prolonged proliferative response not only to stimuli related to liver regeneration but also to xenobiotic chemical mitogens, such as PB.  Liver-specific ablation of integrin-linked kinase in mice results in enhanced and prolonged cell proliferation and hepatomegaly after phenobarbital administration.  Enhanced liver regeneration following changes induced by hepatocyte-specific genetic ablation of integrin-linked kinase.  ILK deficiency caused an aberrant distribution of nephrin and alpha-actinin-4 in podocytes, whereas the localization of podocin and synaptopodin remained relatively intact.  Targeted ablation of ILK from the murine heart results in dilated cardiomyopathy and spontaneous heart failure.  Here we show that targeted ablation of the integrin-linked kinase (ILK) expression results in spontaneous cardiomyopathy and heart failure by 6 wk of age.  Together, these results suggest that ILK plays a central role in protecting the mammalian heart against cardiomyopathy and failure.  Our results show for the first time in vivo the significance of ILK and hepatic ECM-signaling for regulation of hepatocyte proliferation and differentiation.  Liver-specific ablation of integrin-linked kinase in mice results in abnormal histology, enhanced cell proliferation, and hepatomegaly.

"[SOC]###context: Further clinical implications are described (capability of learning the therapeutic strategies, deliverability in broader clinical settings, acceptability by patients, combination with atypical neuroleptic drugs,and treatment of choice in risk populations).  Intervention strategies are a multimodal psychological programme for the intervention in early prodromal stages and a combination of psychotherapy with atypical neuroleptic drugs in the late prodromal stages.   Atypical neuroleptic drugs have enriched our treatment programs, especially in childhood and adolescent schizophrenia.  Reviewed here is the use of atypical neuroleptics in children and adolescents with a schizophrenic disorder.   o prove whether weight gain is a relevant side effect of atypical neuroleptics, the charts of all patients admitted with DSM-III-R diagnoses of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or delusional disorder in the years 1991 to 1995 were evaluated.  The handwriting of 18 schizophrenic patients before and during treatment with typical (haloperidol, haloperidol decanoate) and atypical (clozapine, risperidone) neuroleptic drugs was examined.  Atypical and typical neuroleptics, when administered chronically, can bring about profound but contrasting changes in schizophrenic symptoms and motor activation and dramatically modulate brain neurochemistry Recent studies suggest that clozapine is more effective than typical neuroleptics for patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia.  Acute and late onset movement disorders frequently complicate the treatment of psychosis with typical neuroleptic drugs like haloperidol, but not with atypical neuroleptic drugs like clozapine.   Only the group of boys presented other comorbidities such as negativism and conduct disorders; approximately 25% of them required treatment with atypical neuroleptic drugs.  Atypical neuroleptic drugs are the preferred treatment for symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, agitation and aggressive behaviour.  Monotherapeutic treatment with new atypical neuroleptic drugs had a more positive effect on the mental health related quality of life (MCS) in comparison to treatment with polypharmacological treatment but not with oral conventional antipsychotics.

"[SOC]###context: Although devoid of recurrent single nucleotide variants and focal copy number aberrations, poor-prognosis hindbrain ependymomas exhibit a CpG island methylator phenotype Although no recurrently mutated genes were found throughout these groups of ependymomas, PFA exhibited a CpG island methylator phenotype, PFB was associated with extensive chromosomal aberrations, and the C11orf95-RELA fusion gene was frequently observed in supratentorial ependymomas.   Supratentorial and spinal pediatric ependymomas display a hypermethylated phenotype which includes the loss of tumor suppressor genes involved in the control of cell growth and death.  Supratentorial and spinal tumors displayed significantly more hypermethylated genes than posterior fossa tumors, similar to the 'CpG island methylator phenotype' (CIMP) identified in glioma and colon carcinoma.  The data suggests epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes is an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of supratentorial and spinal, but not posterior fossa ependymomas.

"[SOC]###context: Excess relative risk of new brain tumor averaged 1. 29 (95% confidence interval, 0. 66-1. 93) for pediatric patients exposed to one or more head CTs.  Tumor incidence increased with number of pediatric head CTs in a dose-dependent manner, with measurable excess incidence even after a single scan.  Converging evidence from epidemiological studies supported a small excess risk of brain tumor incidence after even a single CT exam in pediatric patients.   Recent epidemiologic evidence from a national registry of children who underwent CT scans suggests a higher-than-expected incidence of secondary tumors.   However, we found 1) a statistically significant correlation between radiation dose and age at procedure, as well as number and type of procedures, and 2) a substantial increase in lifetime predicted risk of tumor above baseline in the cohort of young children who undergo neurointerventions. CONCLUSIONS: Although neurointerventional procedures have dramatically improved the prognosis of children facing serious cerebrovascular conditions, the predicted risk of secondary tumors, particularly in the youngest patients and those undergoing multiple procedures, is sobering.  Conclusion When prevalent cases of meningioma at first exposure to CT of the head are excluded, no statistically significant increase in risk of meningioma was found among exposed subjects compared with unexposed control subjects.   data suggest that 1 excess brain malignancy occurred after 4000 brain CTs (40 mSv per scan) and that the estimated risk in the 10 years following CT exposure was 1 brain tumor per 10,000 patients exposed to a 10 mGy scan at less than 10 years of age. CONCLU SIONS: The model predicts that the effective radiation dose from a single head CT is capable of inducing a thyroid or brain tumor in an infant or child.  These Neither whole head CT nor cumulative brain dose to the brain increased the risk of glioma or of all brain tumours.  rison of exposed and unexposed cohorts showed that there was no statistically significant increase in the risk of meningioma after exposure to CT of the head (HR: 1. 49; 95% confidence interval: 0. 97, 2. 30; P = . 07).

This was har Tumor incidence increased with number of pediatric head CTs in a dose-dependent manner, with measurable excess incidence even after a single scan.  Converging evidence from epidemiological studies supported a small excess risk of brain tumor incidence after even a single CT exam in pediatric patients.  Excess relative risk of new brain tumor averaged 1. 29 (95% confidence interval, 0. 66-1. 93) for pediatric patients exposed to one or more head CTs.  Epidemiological studies consistently cited increased tumor incidence in pediatric patients (ages 0-18) exposed to head CTs.  RESULTS: A positive correlation between exposure to CT scans and developing central nervous system tumors was evident in all cohorts.  The strength of the association varied across the studies.  Exclusion of patients with predisposing factors to central nervous system tumors was examined in four studies with a decreased risk to develop central nervous system tumors noted in three studies.  Two studies reported nonsignificant reduction in the excess relative risk per milliGray of brain dose after adjusting for predisposing factors, whereas the reduction was significant in one study.  The frequency of CT exposure was proportional to the risk of developing tumors in two studies although not significantly maintained in two other studies.   RESULTS: The overall risk was not significantly different in the two cohorts (incidence rate=36. 72 per 100 000 person-years in the exposed cohort, 28. 48 per 100 000 person-years in the unexposed cohort, hazard ratio (HR)=1. 29, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0. 90-1. 85).  The risk of benign brain tumour was significantly higher in the exposed cohort than in the unexposed cohort (HR=2. 97, 95% CI=1. 49-5. 93).  The frequency of CT examination showed strong correlation with the subsequent overall risk of malignancy and benign brain tumour. CONCLUSIONS: We found that paediatric head CT examination was associated with an increased incidence of benign brain tumour.  CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence that CT-related radiation exposure increases brain tumor risk.   Compared with the general population, incidence of brain tumors was higher in the cohort of children with CT scans, requiring cautious interpretation of the findings.  BACKGROUND: Recent studies linking radiation exposure from pediatric computed tomography (CT) to increased risks of leukemia and brain tumors lacked data to control for cancer susceptibility syndromes (CSS).   IMPACT: Future studies should identify TSC patients in order to avoid overestimation of brain tumor risks due to radiation exposure from CT scans.  The radiation-induced occurrence of meningiomas and other brain tumours most probably contributes to the continuously increasing incidence of these diseases which is observed in several industrial nations, as well as the exposure of the bone marrow by CT to the increase of childhood leukaemia.  1,000 annual paediatric CT investigations of the skull will lead to about 3 excess neoplasms in the head region, i. e. , the probability of an induced late effect must be suspected in the range of some thousandths.

"[SOC]###context: The family of cullin-RING E3 Ligases (CRLs) and the constitutive photomorphogenesis 9 (COP9) signalosome (CSN) form dynamic complexes that mediate ubiquitylation of 20% of the proteome, yet regulation of their assembly/disassembly remains poorly understood.   The COP9 (constitutive photomorphogenesis 9) signalosome (CSN) is a protein complex involved in the ubiquitin proteasome system and a common host target of diverse pathogens in Arabidopsis.   The COP9 (Constitutive photomorphogenesis 9) signalosome (CSN), a large multiprotein complex that resembles the 19S lid of the 26S proteasome, plays a central role in the regulation of the E3-cullin RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs).  The mammalian constitutive photomorphogenesis 9 (COP9) signalosome (CSN), a protein complex involved in embryonic development, is implicated in cell cycle regulation and the DNA damage response.  Its role in tumor development, however, remains unclear.  COP9 plays a role in plant innate immunity.   The constitutive photomorphogenesis 9 signalosome (COP9 or CSN) is an evolutionarily conserved multiprotein complex found in plants and animals.  Because of the homology between the COP9 signalosome and the 19S lid complex of the proteosome, COP9 has been postulated to play a role in regulating the degradation of polyubiquitinated proteins.   Therefore, it is conceivable that COP9 plays a significant role in cancer, regulating processes relevant to carcinogenesis and cancer progression (e. g. , cell cycle control, signal transduction and apoptosis).   The constitutive photomorphogenesis 9 (COP9) signalosome (CSN) plays key roles in many biological processes, such as repression of photomorphogenesis in plants and protein subcellular localization, DNA-damage response, and NF-κB activation in mammals.

CSN6 is one subunit of the constitutive photomorphogenesis 9 (COP9) signalosome (CSN), which is an evolutionarily conserved multiprotein complex found in plants and animals and originally described as a repressor of light-dependent growth and transcription in Arabidopsis.  CSN6, a critical subunit of the constitutive photomorphogenesis 9 (COP9) signalosome (CSN), has received attention as a regulator of the degradation of cancer-related proteins such as p53, c-myc and c-Jun, through the ubiquitin-proteasome system, suggesting its importance in cancerogenesis.  The COP9 signalosome (CSN) is a complex of eight proteins first identified as a repressor of plant photomorphogenesis.  COP10 is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme variant (UEV), which is thought to act together with COP1, DET1, and the COP9 signalosome (CSN) in Arabidopsis to repress photomorphogenesis.  The COP9 (constitutive photomorphogenesis mutant 9) signalosome (CSN) may regulate the UPS, but this has not been tested in a critical vertebrate organ.

The mammalian constitutive photomorphogenesis 9 (COP9) signalosome (CSN), a protein complex involved in embryonic development, is implicated in cell cycle regulation and the DNA damage response.   Recent studies indicate that Int6 is a multifaceted protein involved in the regulation of protein translation and degradation through binding with three complexes: the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, the proteasome regulatory lid, and the constitutive photomorphogenesis 9 signalosome.   The COP9 Signalosome (CSN) is a multiprotein complex that was originally identified in Arabidopsis thaliana as a negative regulator of photomorphogenesis and subsequently shown to be a general eukaryotic regulator of developmental signaling.   In this report we demonstrate a JNK-independent activation of c-Jun in vivo directed by the constitutive photomorphogenesis (COP9) signalosome.   The COP9 signalosome (CSN) is a multiprotein complex that was initially identified in plants as a repressor of photomorphogenesis.  This study suggests that AtItpk-1 may function as a protein kinase that is involved in photomorphogenesis possibly via interaction with COP9 signalosome under red light.  The Arabidopsis inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate 5/6 kinase, AtItpk-1, is involved in plant photomorphogenesis under red light conditions, possibly via interaction with COP9 signalosome.

"[SOC]###context: This article discusses some of these unresolved issues, including the use of medications such as nimodipine, antifibrinolytics, statins, and magnesium; coiling or clipping for aneurysm securement; and the prevention and treatment of potential complications.  The results of this study were as follows: nimodipine demonstrated benefit following aneurysmal SAH; other calcium channel blockers, including nicardipine, do not provide unequivocal benefit; triple-H therapy, fasudil, transluminal balloon angioplasty, thrombolytics, endothelin receptor antagonists, magnesium, statins, and miscellaneous therapies such as free radical scavengers and antifibrinolytics require additional study.  The present results suggest that fasudil is equally or more effective than nimodipine for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm and subsequent ischemic injury in patients undergoing surgery for SAH.  Three studies (2 meta-analyses and 1 randomized controlled trial) demonstrated that nimodipine use confers benefits (reduced morbidity and mortality) for patients with aneurysmatic subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Nimodipine is the only preventative treatment that can be recommended.  Nimodipine (Nimotop), HMG Co-A reductase inhibitor (statins) and enoxaparin (Lovenox) were the only drugs with level-1 evidence available for the treatment of vasospasm from aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage as defined by the US Preventative Services Task Force.  The calcium antagonist nimodipine has been shown to reduce the incidence of ischemic complications following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).  There was no significant difference in the incidence of DINDs (28 vs 30% in the peroral and intravenous groups, respectively) or middle cerebral artery blood flow velocities (> 120 cm/second, 50 vs 45%, respectively).  Clinical outcome according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale was the same in both groups, and there was no difference in the number of patients with new infarctions on MR imaging.  The results suggest that there is no clinically relevant difference in efficacy between peroral and intravenous administration of nimodipine in preventing DINDs or cerebral vasospasm following SAH.  the risk of delayed cerebral ischemia is reduced with nimodipine and avoiding hypovolemia A recommendations (standard) for the prophylaxis and treatment of cerebral vasospasm with oral Nimodipine in good grade patients.  Of the 75 patients initially considered for active treatment, 83% underwent surgery within 48 hours of rupture, all received nimodipine, 16% received tissue plasminogen activator to lyse subarachnoid or intraventricular clots, 40% underwent hypertensive treatment, and 7% underwent transluminal balloon angioplasty for vasospasm.  All patients with aneurysmal SAH should be treated with the calcium antagonist nimodipine, and in certain circumstances patients should receive anticonvulsants.  The following review gives an account of pathophysiological mechanisms; the importance of treatment with calcium antagonists, hypervolaemic haemodilution, and induced arterial hypertension is discussed in light of the current literature.  Seven placebo-controlled clinical studies have shown that nimodipine improves the outcome of patients with severe neurological damage due to cerebral vasospasm.  In a series of 100 individuals with a ruptured supratentorial aneurysm, who were subjected to aneurysm operation in the acute stage and who subsequently received intravenous treatment with the calcium channel blocker nimodipine, the occurrence of DID with FND was reduced to 5%.  There are many possible successful treatment options for preventing vasospasm, delayed ischemic neurologic deficits, and poor neurologic outcome following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage; however, further multicenter RCTs need to be performed to determine if there is a significant benefit from their use.  Nimodipine is the only treatment that provided a significant benefit across multiple studies.  Absence of symptomatic vasospasm, occurrence of low density areas associated with vasospasm on CT, and occurrence of adverse events were similar between the two groups.  The clinical outcomes were more favorable in the fasudil group than in the nimodipine group (p = 0. 040).  The proportion of patients with good clinical outcome was 74. 5% (41/55) in the fasudil group and 61. 7% (37/60) in the nimodipine group.  Cerebral vasospasm is the classic cause of delayed neurological deterioration leading to cerebral ischemia and infarction, and thus, poor outcome and occasionally death, after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).  Advances in diagnosis and treatment, principally nimodipine, intensive care management, hemodynamic manipulations, and endovascular neuroradiology procedures, have improved the prospects for these patients, but outcomes remain disappointing.  Cerebral vasospasm is the classic cause of delayed neurological deterioration after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, leading to cerebral ischemia and infarction, and thus to poor outcome and occasionally death.  Advances in diagnosis and treatment-principally the use of nimodipine, intensive care management, hemodynamic manipulations and endovascular neuroradiology procedures-have improved the prospects for these patients, but outcomes remain disappointing.  Cerebral vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia remain common complications of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and yet therapies for cerebral vasospasm are limited.  Despite a large number of clinical trials, only calcium antagonists have strong evidence supporting their effectiveness.  The only proven therapy for vasospasm is nimodipine.  nimodipine is indicated after SAH and tirilazad is not effective.  Fasudil hydrochloride and nimodipine both showed inhibitory effects on cerebral vasospasm.  The incidence of symptomatic vasospasm was five of 33 patients in the fasudil group and nine of 32 patients in the nimodipine group.  Good recovery evaluated by the Glasgow Outcome Scale was achieved by 23 of 33 patients in the fasudil group and 19 of 34 patients in the nimodipine group.  Both drugs significantly improved consciousness levels and neurological deficits such as aphasia.  However, fasudil hydrochloride improved motor disturbance more than nimodipine. 
###question: Is nimodipine recommended for prevention of vasospasm in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients?[EOC] [SOR]###response: Yes, nimodipine is recommended and FDA approved for prevention of vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Multiple studies have demonstrated that nimodipine (administered orally or intravenously) is safe and effective for prevention of vasospasm, and reduce frequency of ischemic complications, lowered mortality and improved overall outcomes.  Other preventive medication can be also effective for vasomotor prevention in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients. [EOR]"
"[SOC]###context: Combined BRAF (Dabrafenib) and MEK inhibition (Trametinib) in patients with BRAFV600-mutant melanoma experiencing progression with single-agent BRAF inhibitor.   Here, we report patients treated with combination therapy after disease progression with BRAF inhibitor treatment administered before study enrollment (part B; n = 26) or after cross-over at progression with dabrafenib monotherapy (part C; n = 45).   This randomized phase 3 study evaluated the combination of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib and the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib.   METHODS: All patients treated with the BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib or dabrafenib or combination BRAF inhibitor and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor therapy at Westmead Hospital, Sydney, Australia underwent regular dermatological assessments for the duration of therapy.  We assessed the safety and efficacy of combined BRAF inhibition with vemurafenib and MEK inhibition with cobimetinib in patients with advanced BRAF-mutated melanoma.   We included individuals who had either recently progressed on vemurafenib or never received a BRAF inhibitor.   However, it is becoming evident that the effects of paradoxical mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation by BRAF inhibitors in non-BRAF-mutant cells needs to be taken into account, which may be implicated in the problems encountered in the first clinical trial testing a combination of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib with ipilimumab (anti-CTLA4), with significant liver toxicities.  The BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib recently was approved for use in patients with BRAF V600-mutated metastatic melanoma.  His treatment course to date has included surgery, adjuvant radiotherapy, and interferon, metastasectomies, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors, a clinical trial with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX-4032), clinical trial with combination BRAF plus MEK inhibition with vemurafenib plus GDC-0973, and combination targeted and immune therapy with vemurafenib plus the anti-CTLA4 antibody ipilimumab.  Thirty-one patients commenced dabrafenib therapy including six individuals who had progressed on a prior BRAF-inhibitor treatment.  Population pharmacokinetics of dabrafenib, a BRAF inhibitor: effect of dose, time, covariates, and relationship with its metabolites.  Dabrafenib is a BRAF kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of BRAF V600E mutation-positive melanoma.   This was a prospective study of melanoma patients harboring the BRAF V600 mutation and treated with iBRAF within a clinical trial (dabrafenib) or as part of an expanded access program (vemurafenib).  We investigated the BRAF kinase inhibitor vemurafenib in patients with advanced melanoma with symptomatic brain metastases.  This discovery led to the development of BRAF kinase inhibitors like vemurafenib and dabrafenib.   CONCLUSIONS: Dabrafenib joins vemurafenib to confirm the superior clinical outcome of the BRAF inhibitors when compared with dacarbazine in patients with BRAF(V600E)-positive advanced melanoma.   Tumor genetic analyses of patients with metastatic melanoma treated with the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib (GSK2118436).  PURPOSE: Dabrafenib is a selective inhibitor of V600-mutant BRAF kinase, which recently showed improved progression-free survival (PFS) as compared with dacarbazine, in metastatic melanoma patients.   Phase II trial (BREAK-2) of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib (GSK2118436) in patients with metastatic melanoma.  PURPOSE: Dabrafenib (GSK2118436) is a potent inhibitor of mutated BRAF kinase.  Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is a concerning toxicity with BRAF inhibitors in the treatment for melanoma.  While the two drugs shown to improve survival, vemurafenib, and dabrafenib, have similar efficacy, the reported rates of cSCC are quite different.  PURPOSE To assess pharmacodynamic effects and intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib in BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma, leading to an understanding of the mechanism of action of vemurafenib and ultimately to optimization of metastatic melanoma therapy.   BACKGROUND: The cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test is a CE-marked and FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic assay used to select patients with metastatic melanoma for treatment with the selective BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib The purpose of this study is to review the development of BRAF inhibitors, with emphasis on the trials conducted with dabrafenib (GSK2118436) and the evolving role of dabrafenib in treatment for melanoma patients.  Dabrafenib inhibits the mutant BRAF (BRAF(mut)) protein in melanomas with BRAF(V600E) and BRAF(V600K) genotypes.  To address this problem, we conducted a phase 1 and 2 trial of combined treatment with dabrafenib, a selective BRAF inhibitor, and trametinib, a selective MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor.  Cutaneous manifestations of dabrafenib (GSK2118436): a selective inhibitor of mutant BRAF in patients with metastatic melanoma.  We conducted a systematic prospective dermatological review of all patients enrolled at a single institution in the phase I/II clinical trial of the mutant BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib (GSK2118436).  CONCLUSIONS: Administration of the mutant BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib is associated with induction of keratinocytic proliferation, which in some cases develops features of low-grade malignancy.  Neoplastic leptomeningitis presenting in a melanoma patient treated with dabrafenib (a V600EBRAF inhibitor): a case report.  For this reason, she was enrolled into another clinical trial with the GSK2118436 BRAF inhibitor, dabrafenib, as a second line of therapy.  BACKGROUND: The development of keratoacanthomas (KAs) and well-differentiated squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) is a known adverse effect of novel BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib.  OBSERVATIONS: We describe a patient with stage IV melanoma who received the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration) as part of a clinical trial and developed numerous diffuse, pathology-proven KAs and SCCs.   CONCLUSIONS: Given vemurafenib's recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration, we provide a timely case report on the effective use of PDT in the treatment of BRAF inhibitor-associated KAs and SCCs.   The BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib, has shown up to 78% objective response rates in melanoma patients harboring the BRAF-V600E mutation but not in patients lacking the mutation.   The oral BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX4032) frequently produced tumor regressions in patients with BRAF V600-mutant metastatic melanoma in a phase 1 trial and improved overall survival in a phase 3 trial.   CONTEXT: A polymerase chain reaction-based companion diagnostic (cobas 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test) was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to select patients with BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma for treatment with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib.   However, in the recent clinical trial of the BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib (PLX4032), a significant percentage of BRAF V600E mutant melanoma patients did not meet the RECIST criteria for a response.   Vemurafenib (RG7204/PLX4032), a small-molecule inhibitor of mutant BRAF, has shown striking clinical efficacy in BRAFV600 mutant melanoma, creating the need for a well-validated companion diagnostic to select patients for treatment.  BACKGROUND: Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials of the BRAF kinase inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX4032) have shown response rates of more than 50% in patients with metastatic melanoma with the BRAF V600E mutation.  Vemurafenib is the first molecularly targeted therapy to be licensed in the US and Europe for treatment of advanced melanoma Clinical trials to test the efficacy of vemurafenib in combination with immunomodulatory agents, such as ipilimumab, and MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitors, such as GDC-0973, in the treatment of advanced melanoma are currently underway

"[SOC]###context: IL11 is a crucial determinant of cardiovascular fibrosis.  Using integrated imaging-genomics analyses of primary human fibroblasts, we found that Interleukin 11 (IL11) upregulation is the dominant transcriptional response to TGFB1 exposure and required for its profibrotic effect.  IL11 and its receptor (IL11RA) are expressed specifically in fibroblasts where they drive non-canonical, ERK-dependent autocrine signalling that is required for fibrogenic protein synthesis.  In mice, fibroblast-specific Il11 transgene expression or Il11 injection causes heart and kidney fibrosis and organ failure whereas genetic deletion of Il11ra1 is protective against disease.  Thus, inhibition of IL11 prevents fibroblast activation across organs and species in response to a range of important pro-fibrotic stimuli.  These data reveal a central role of IL11 in fibrosis and we propose inhibition of IL11 as a new therapeutic strategy to treat fibrotic diseases.  IL11 is a crucial determinant of cardiovascular fibrosis.

"[SOC]###context: Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome is an autosomal dominant inherited phacomatosis with a predisposition for the central nervous system and retina.  There is variable expression with hemangioblastomas in the brain, medulla oblongata, spinal chord, renal carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, pancreatic cysts and islet cell tumors as well as tumors of the endolymphatic sac of the inner ear.  Clinical symptoms occur first after an age of approximately 30 years.  Von Hippel-Lindau Disease (VHL) is an autosomal dominant inherited systemic cancer syndrome that gives rise to cystic and highly vascularized tumors in many organs, including the eye.  Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a hereditary, autosomal dominant syndrome which is manifested by a range of different benign and malignant tumors.  This disease can present with different clinical presentations such as; retinal angioma (RA), hemangioblastoma (HB) of the central nervous system (CNS), pheochromocytoma (Pheo), and epididymal cystadenoma.  Tumors are usually accompanied with cysts.  von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal-dominant familial cancer syndrome associated with mutations of the VHL tumor suppressor gene (3p25-26).  Its estimated incidence ranges from 1 in 36,000 to 1 in 53,000 with a penetrance of up to 95% by age 60.  Genotype-phenotype correlation divides VHL into two broad clinical subtypes.  Type 1 VHL is predominantly associated with large deletion or truncation mutations which result in an encoded protein with very little or no activity.  It is associated with retinal and CNS hemangioblastoma and renal cell carcinoma but not pheochromocytoma.  Type 2 is usually associated with missense mutations encoding a protein with limited activity and includes pheochromocytoma.  It is further classified into three other subtypes (2A, 2B, 2C) based on the presence of hemangioblastoma and renal cell carcinoma.  Visceral cysts in the kidney, pancreas and epididymis, nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors which often show distinctive clear cell cytology, endolymphatic sac tumors and head and neck paragangliomas are well recognized but less common presenting features.  von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an inheritable multisystem tumor syndrome characterized by multiple benign and malignant tumors affecting multiple organs.  VHL is the result of a germline mutation in the VHL tumor suppressor gene.  Molecular genomic analysis routinely confirms the clinical diagnosis.  Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome (1/36,000 live births) with highly penetrance that predispose to the development of a panel of highly vascularized tumors (model of tumoral angiogenesis).  Main manifestations include central nervous system (CNS) and retinal haemangioblastomas, endolymphatic sac tumors, clear-cell renal cell carcinomas (RCC), phaeochromocytomas and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.  Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an inherited syndrome caused by germline mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene, predisposing to a variety of neoplasms including pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNET).   Von Hippel-Lindau disease is an autosomal dominant disorder involving the development of specific tumours in multiple organs, both benign and malignant.  In the CNS, the syndrome is characterized by haemangioblastomas of the retina, spinal cord and brain.   Patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) often harbor significant disease burden within the CNS, specifically craniospinal-axis hemangioblastomas and endolymphatic sac tumors (ELSTs).  The majority (60-80%) of patients with VHL harbor hemangioblastomas, and 10-15% will develop ELSTs.  Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome is an autosomal dominant familial cancer syndrome predisposing the affected individuals to multiple tumours in various organs.  von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) disease increases susceptibility to several malignancies, including renal cell carcinoma, haemangioblastomas of the central nervous system or retina and phaeochromocytomas.  The VHL tumour suppressor gene, responsible for the disease, encodes for a major regulator of the hypoxic response by targeting the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) for degradation.  Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHLS) is an autosomal dominant familial cancer syndrome arising from germ-line inactivation of the VHL gene on the short arm of chromosome 3.  VHLS manifests in a myriad of hyper-vascular tumors of both benign and malignant nature.  Incidence of VHLS is roughly 1 in 36,000 live births and has over 90% penetrance by the age of 65.   Inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor gene is responsible for the development of renal carcinomas, pheochromocytomas and tumours in other organs.  The gene product (pVHL) is a central component in the oxygen-sensing pathway through its role in the regulation of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF).  Loss of pVHL leads to activation of the HIF pathway in normoxia with the concomitant increase in tumour vascularisation due to the up-regulation of pro-angiogenic genes.  Germ line inactivation of the von-Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene causes von Hippel-Lindau hereditary cancer syndrome, and somatic mutations of this gene have been linked to the development of sporadic hemangioblastomas and clear cell renal carcinomas.  The protein encoded by VHL, pVHL, has no known enzymatic activities but interacts with various partner proteins.  pVHL acts as a multi-purpose adaptor protein that controls different gene expression programs.  Through its oxygen-dependent regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIFalpha), pVHL plays a central role in the oxygen-sensing pathway.  In addition, many HIFalpha-independent functions of pVHL have recently been identified.  These include microtubule-based processes, extracellular matrix assembly and suppression of kidney cyst formation.   von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an inherited multisystem familial cancer syndrome caused by mutations of the VHL gene on chromosome 3p25.  A wide variety of neoplastic processes are known to be associated with VHL disease.   von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a rare, autosomal dominantly inherited multisystem disorder characterized by development of a variety of benign and malignant tumors.  The spectrum of clinical manifestations of the disease is broad and includes retinal and central nervous system hemangioblastomas, endolymphatic sac tumors, renal cysts and tumors, pancreatic cysts and tumors, pheochromocytomas, and epididymal cystadenomas.  The most common causes of death in VHL disease patients are renal cell carcinoma and neurologic complications from cerebellar hemangioblastomas.

"[SOC]###context: Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 are nuclear-replicating viruses composed of a double-stranded DNA genome  Vectors derived from herpes simplex virus provide a means of gene delivery to postmitotic neurons.  The virus is readily taken up at nerve terminals, passes by rapid retrograde and anterograde transport within neurons, and is selectively transferred across synapses, thus allowing it entry from the periphery into the brain.  This virus can enter a state of latency in some neurons, where it exists as an episomal element in the nucleus and is transcriptionally active to a reduced extent.  In this state, the virus is apparently benign and can effect stable expression of foreign genes.

Deletion of Arg(14) disrupts the protein kinase A recognition motif, which abrogates phospholamban phosphorylation and results in constitutive SERCA inhibition.  Mutation of Arg(9) causes more complex changes in function, where hydrophobic substitutions such as cysteine and leucine eliminate both SERCA inhibition and phospholamban phosphorylation, whereas an aromatic substitution such as histidine selectively disrupts phosphorylation.  We demonstrate that the role of Arg(9) in phospholamban function is multifaceted: it is important for inhibition of SERCA, it increases the efficiency of phosphorylation, and it is critical for protein kinase A recognition in the context of the phospholamban pentamer.  Given the synergistic consequences on contractility, it is not surprising that the mutants cause lethal, hereditary dilated cardiomyopathy.  Phospholamban (PLN) is a key regulator of SR and cardiac function, and PLN mutations in humans have been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).  We previously reported the deletion of the highly conserved amino acid residue arginine 14 (nucleic acids 39, 40 and 41) in DCM patients.  To assess the function of this mutant PLN, we introduced the PLN-R14Del in cardiac myocytes of the PLN null mouse.  Thus, human PLN-R14Del is misrouted to the sarcolemma, in the absence of endogenous PLN, and alters NKA activity, leading to cardiac remodeling.  Mutations in the gene encoding PLN have been associated with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy; however, no systematic search for PLN mutations in heart failure has been conducted.  Two patients presented a G-T missense mutation at the G26 nucleotide, which encodes an Arg-Leu substitution at codon 9 (R9L).  One patient presented a G-A missense mutation at the same nucleotide, which encodes an Arg-His substitution at codon 9 (R9H).  The fourth affected patient presented a T-G nonsense mutation at the nucleotide 116, substituting a termination codon for Leu-39 (L39stop).  The genetic analysis was focused on R9C mutation with the ability to block PLN phosphorylation leading to chronic inhibition of SERCA2a activity.  Another analysed mutation causing the alteration of PLN level in cells was related to the substitution of a leucine residue at position 39 with a premature stop codon (L39X).   A missense mutation in PLN cytoplasmic domain (R9C) triggers dilated cardiomyopathy in humans, leading to premature death.   These effects are enhanced under oxidizing conditions, suggesting that oxidative stress may exacerbate the cardiotoxic effects of the PLN(R9C) mutant.   We identified 1 family with a deletion of arginine 14 in the PLN.  Interestingly, unlike other individuals reported with the identical PLN mutation, these individuals were not diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy until their seventh decade when they were only mildly symptomatic with congestive heart failure.   Phospholamban R14 deletion results in late-onset, mild, hereditary dilated cardiomyopathy.  Through genetic screening of dilated cardiomyopathy patients, we identified a previously uncharacterized deletion of arginine 14 (PLN-R14Del) in the coding region of the phospholamban (PLN) gene in a large family with hereditary heart failure.  No homozygous individuals were identified.  By middle age, heterozygous individuals developed left ventricular dilation, contractile dysfunction, and episodic ventricular arrhythmias, with overt heart failure in some cases.  Transgenic mice overexpressing the mutant PLN-R14Del recapitulated human cardiomyopathy exhibiting similar histopathologic abnormalities and premature death.  A mutation in the human phospholamban gene, deleting arginine 14, results in lethal, hereditary cardiomyopathy.  Here, a T116G point mutation, substituting a termination codon for Leu-39 (L39stop), was identified in two families with hereditary heart failure.  The heterozygous individuals exhibited hypertrophy without diminished contractile performance.  Strikingly, both individuals homozygous for L39stop developed dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure, requiring cardiac transplantation at ages 16 and 27.   Here we report that an inherited human dilated cardiomyopathy with refractory congestive heart failure is caused by a dominant Arg --> Cys missense mutation at residue 9 (R9C) in phospholamban (PLN), a transmembrane phosphoprotein that inhibits the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticular Ca2+-adenosine triphosphatase (SERCA2a) pump.  Transgenic PLN(R9C) mice recapitulated human heart failure with premature death.  Cellular and biochemical studies revealed that, unlike wild-type PLN, PLN(R9C) did not directly inhibit SERCA2a.  Rather, PLN(R9C) trapped protein kinase A (PKA), which blocked PKA-mediated phosphorylation of wild-type PLN and in turn delayed decay of calcium transients in myocytes.   Phospholamban R14del mutation in patients diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy or arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: evidence supporting the concept of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.  The PLN -42 C>G mutation was found in one patient with late onset familial apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

"[SOC]###context: An analysis of publicly available data from the Phase II studies for bapineuzumab and solanezumab indicates that neither compound produced compelling evidence of drug-like behavior that would justify their progression into pivotal trials.   Notably, a recent study of solanezumab, an amyloid β monoclonal antibody, raises hope for the further therapeutic potential of immunotherapy, not only in Alzheimer's disease, but also for other neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease.   For example, Eli Lilly announced a major change to its closely watched clinical trial for the Alzheimer's drug solanezumab which failed to reach statistical significance.   Areas covered: This contradiction prompted us to review all study phases of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG), Bapineuzumab, Solanezumab, Avagacestat and Dimebolin to shed more light on these recent failures.    Results from phase III clinical trials in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with two monoclonal antibodies bapineuzumab and solanezumab and intravenous immunoglobulin have been disappointing.  Subsequent analysis of pooled data from both phase III trials with solanezumab showed a reduction in cognitive decline in patients with mild AD.  Secondary analyses of EXPEDITION studies suggested a smaller functional effect of solanezumab relative to cognition.  An increasing effect of solanezumab over 18 months was shown for cognition and function.  RESULTS: In the mild AD population, less cognitive and functional decline was observed with solanezumab (n = 659) versus placebo (n = 663), measured by Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive subscale, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living functional scale Instrumental ADLs.   The promising results obtained with aducanumab and solanezumab against Alzheimer's disease (AD) strengthen the vaccine approach to prevent AD, despite of the many clinical setbacks.   CONCLUSIONS: Solanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds amyloid, failed to improve cognition or functional ability.   Results from phase III clinical trials in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with two monoclonal antibodies bapineuzumab and solanezumab and intravenous immunoglobulin have been disappointing.

"[SOC]###context: We found a very significant increase in average longevity (17%) of the cyclists when compared with the general population.  The age at which 50% of the general population died was 73. 5 vs.  81. 5 years in Tour de France participants.  Our major finding is that repeated very intense exercise prolongs life span in well trained practitioners.  Competitive exercise does not induce cardiac damage in individuals with healthy hearts, but does induce physiological functional and structural cardiac adaptations which have positive effects on life expectancy.  Medallists lived an average of 2. 8 years longer than controls.  Medallists in eight of the nine country groups had a significant survival advantage compared with controls.  Gold, silver, and bronze medallists each enjoyed similar sized survival advantages.  Medallists in endurance sports and mixed sports had a larger survival advantage over controls at 30 years (1. 13, 1. 09 to 1. 17; 1. 11, 1. 09 to 1. 13) than that of medallists in power sports (1. 05, 1. 01 to 1. 08).  CONCLUSIONS: Olympic medallists live longer than the general population, irrespective of country, medal, or sport.  This study was not designed to explain this effect, but possible explanations include genetic factors, physical activity, healthy lifestyle, and the wealth and status that come with international sporting glory.  Long-term endurance training induces in elderly subjects an increased HRV and a higher exercise working capacity, which are well-established predictors of cardiovascular and overall mortality.  Sports activity in adolescents and young adults was associated with an increased risk of SD, both in males and females.  Sports, per se, was not a cause of the enhanced mortality, but it triggered SD in those athletes who were affected by cardiovascular conditions predisposing to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias during physical exercise. 
###question: is intense physical activity associated with longevity ?[EOC] [SOR]###response: Several survival studies showed that professional athletes has higher longevity than general population.  These epidemiological data matches the evidences that long-term endurance training induces in elderly subjects an increased HRV and a higher exercise working capacity, which are well-established predictors of cardiovascular and overall mortality, and also telomere length.

"[SOC]###context: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The results of phase 2 randomized controlled trials for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine demonstrating the efficacy and safety of four mAbs targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) pathway [ALD403 (eptinezumab), AMG334 (erenumab), LY2951742 (galcanezumab) and TEV48125 (fremanezumab)] have been published recently, and phase 3 trials are in process.   Selective Inhibition of Trigeminovascular Neurons by Fremanezumab: A Humanized Monoclonal Anti-CGRP Antibody.  Recently, a new class of such drugs, humanized anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies (CGRP-mAbs), were found to be effective in reducing the frequency of migraine.  The purpose of this study was to better understand how the CGRP-mAb fremanezumab (TEV-48125) modulates meningeal sensory pathways.  BACKGROUND: Fremanezumab (formerly TEV-48125) is a monoclonal antibody directed against calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP), a validated target for migraine preventive therapy.   Fremanezumab-A Humanized Monoclonal Anti-CGRP Antibody-Inhibits Thinly Myelinated (Aδ) But Not Unmyelinated (C) Meningeal Nociceptors.   As a new approach to migraine treatment, humanized anti-CGRP monoclonal antibodies (CGRP-mAbs) were developed to reduce the availability of CGRP, and were found effective in reducing the frequency of chronic and episodic migraine.  We recently tested the effect of fremanezumab (TEV-48125), a CGRP-mAb, on the activity of second-order trigeminovascular dorsal horn neurons that receive peripheral input from the cranial dura, and found a selective inhibition of high-threshold but not wide-dynamic range class of neurons.  To investigate the basis for this selective inhibitory effect, and further explore the mechanism of action of CGRP-mAbs, we tested the effect of fremanezumab on the cortical spreading depression-evoked activation of mechanosensitive primary afferent meningeal nociceptors that innervate the cranial dura, using single-unit recording in the trigeminal ganglion of anesthetized male rats.  Discussion Clinical data from phase II and III trials of the four monoclonal antibodies targeting the CGRP pathway: Eptinezumab, erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab, collectively show a positive effect in the preventive treatment of episodic and chronic migraine.

The BXSB Y chromosome-linked mutant gene, Yaa, accelerates the progression of a lupus-like autoimmune syndrome only in mice that are predisposed to autoimmune diseases.

Our results suggest that the Yaa gene, unlike the lpr gene, exhibits selective autoimmune accelerating activity, but as a result of increased formation of certain nephritogenic autoantibodies such as anti-gp70 antibodies, the Yaa gene is able to accelerate the progression of lupus-like nephritis in lupus-prone mice.  Linkage of a major quantitative trait locus to Yaa gene-induced lupus-like nephritis in (NZW x C57BL/6)F1 mice.

Our study thus provides a model to dissect the complex genetic interactions that result in manifestations of murine lupus-like disease.  The Yaa gene abrogates the major histocompatibility complex association of murine lupus in (NZB x BXSB)F1 hybrid mice.  These data indicate that (a) the conventional H-2b is a haplotype leading to susceptibility for murine SLE, while H-2d is a relatively resistant haplotype; (b) the H-2b haplotype exhibits a dominant effect on autoimmune responses, similar to the classical MHC-linked Ir gene effect; and (c) most strikingly, the Yaa gene totally abrogates the MHC effect on murine lupus in (NZB x BXSB)F1 hybrid mice.  The accelerated development of lupus-like autoimmune disease in male BXSB mice (H-2b, I-E-) is associated to the presence of a mutant gene, designated Yaa, located on their Y chromosome.  The Y-linked autoimmune accelerating gene mutation (yaa), first discovered in the BXSB mouse strain, is known to accelerate spontaneous autoantibody production and subsequent development of lupus disease.  The finding that the Yaa gene-induced acceleration of lupus-like autoimmune disease is modulated by gene(s) within or closely linked to the H-2 complex underlines the crucial role of the major histocompatibility complex and the polygenetic nature of autoimmune disease in BXSB mice.

Therefore, we examined the effects of a modified MBT protocol (MBT-AS) in high-functioning adults with ASD.  the present study is the first controlled trial to demonstrate that adults with ASD can benefit from MBT-AS.  This pilot, randomized controlled trial evaluated the feasibility and preliminary outcomes of the Multimodal Anxiety and Social Skills Intervention (MASSI) program in a sample of 30 adolescents with ASD and anxiety symptoms of moderate or greater severity.  These findings suggest MASSI is a feasible treatment program and further evaluation is warranted.  The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate whether a modified version of the Coping Cat program could be effective in reducing anxiety in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).  the Coping Cat program (cognitive-behavioral therapy; CBT) Results provide preliminary evidence that a modified version of the Coping Cat program may be a feasible and effective program for reducing clinically significant levels of anxiety in children with high-functioning ASD.  The intent of this article is to explore the efficacy of both the literal and concrete externalization aspects within narrative therapy, and the implementation of interactive metaphors as a combined psychotherapeutic approach for decreasing anxiety with people who present with high-functioning autism.  This paper reports a case series of children and adolescents with ASD and an anxiety disorder who were treated with a standard cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) rationale adapted to take account of the neuropsychological features of ASD.  children with moderate autistic symptomology (per SRS-P) were significantly more likely to improve from family CBT (FCBT) than individual CBT (ICBT; OR = 8. 67) Though both treatments reduced anxiety, FCBT outperformed ICBT for children with moderate ASD symptoms, a benefit potentially linked to more at-home exposures and greater child involvement in FCBT.  A structural model-building approach was used to test the extent to which family and peer variables directly or indirectly affected ASD via child anxiety/depression.  The key findings were that anxiety/depression and ASD symptomatology were significantly related, and family conflict was more predictive of ASD symptomatology than positive family/peer influences.  The results point to the utility of expanding interventions to include conflict management for couples, even when conflict and family distress is low.

"[SOC]###context: Intrinsic termination signals for multisubunit bacterial RNA polymerases (RNAPs) encode a GC-rich stem-loop structure followed by a polyuridine [poly(U)] tract, and it has been proposed that steric clash of the stem-loop with the exit pore of the RNAP imposes a shearing force on the RNA in the downstream RNA:DNA hybrid, resulting in misalignment of the active site We have observed that transcription through the GC-rich FMR1 5'UTR region favors R-loop formation, with the nascent (G-rich) RNA forming a stable RNA:DNA hybrid with the template DNA strand, thereby displacing the non-template DNA strand.  Transcription termination by bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) occurs at sequences coding for a GC-rich RNA hairpin followed by a U-rich tract.  We used single-molecule techniques to investigate the mechanism by which three representative terminators (his, t500, and tR2) destabilize the elongation complex (EC).

"[SOC]###context: AMPA receptor GluA2 subunit defects are a cause of neurodevelopmental disorders.  AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are tetrameric ligand-gated channels made up of combinations of GluA1-4 subunits encoded by GRIA1-4 genes.  GluA2 has an especially important role because, following post-transcriptional editing at the Q607 site, it renders heteromultimeric AMPARs Ca2+-impermeable, with a linear relationship between current and trans-membrane voltage.  Here, we report heterozygous de novo GRIA2 mutations in 28 unrelated patients with intellectual disability (ID) and neurodevelopmental abnormalities including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Rett syndrome-like features, and seizures or developmental epileptic encephalopathy (DEE).  In functional expression studies, mutations lead to a decrease in agonist-evoked current mediated by mutant subunits compared to wild-type channels.  When GluA2 subunits are co-expressed with GluA1, most GRIA2 mutations cause a decreased current amplitude and some also affect voltage rectification.  Our results show that de-novo variants in GRIA2 can cause neurodevelopmental disorders, complementing evidence that other genetic causes of ID, ASD and DEE also disrupt glutamatergic synaptic transmission.

"[SOC]###context: MicroRNA-301b promotes cell proliferation and apoptosis resistance in triple-negative breast cancer by targeting CYLD.  Aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) plays important roles in carcinogenesis and tumor progression.  However, the expression and biological role of miR-301b in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains unclear.  Here we aimed to evaluate the roles and mechanisms of miR-301b in TNBC cells.  miR-301b expression was assessed in TNBC specimens and cell lines by quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR).  TNBC cells were transfected with miR-301b mimics, inhibitors or Cylindromatosis (CYLD) small interfering RNA (siRNA) using Lipofectamine 2000.  The functional roles of miR-301b were determined by cell proliferation, colony formation, and apoptosis assays.  Western blots and qRT-PCR were used to measure the expression of mRNAs and proteins in the cells.  We found that miR-301b was upregulated in TNBC specimens and cell lines.  Overexpression of miR-301b promoted cell proliferation in TNBC cells, while inhibited the apoptosis induced by 5-FU.  CYLD was downregulated by miR-301b at both mRNA and protein levels in TNBC cells.  Dual-luciferase report assay confirmed that miR-301b downregulated CYLD by direct interaction with the 3'-untranslated region(3'-UTR) of CYLD mRNA.  NF-κB activation was mechanistically associated with miR-301b-mediated downregulation of CYLD.  However, inhibition of miR-301b reversed all the effects of miR-301b.  In conclusion, miR-301b plays an oncogenic role in TNBC possibly by downregulating CYLD and subsequently activating NF-κB p65, and this may provide a novel therapeutic approach for TNBC.  Overexpression of microRNA-182 (miR-182) is found in multiple cancers, but the association of miR-182 expression with the sensitivity of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) remains unknown.  In this study, up-regulation of miR-182 was validated in TNBC patients and cell lines.  Knockdown of miR-182 was observed to hinder the proliferation of BT-549 cells.  More importantly, knockdown of miR-182 significantly promoted the apoptosis induced by TNF-α treatment in BT-549.  JC-1 staining and western blot assays revealed that the K63-linked ubiquitin chains on receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) were removed and the outer mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and permeability was altered upon combination of TNF-α with anti-miR-182.  We then demonstrated that knockdown of miR-182 up-regulated the expression of cylindromatosis (CYLD) deubiquitinase, which promoted the formation of death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) and subsequent caspase-8 activation in TNF-α-treated BT-549 cells.  Collectively, the results of the present study improve our understanding of the role of miR-182 in TNBC, knockdown of which facilitates the degradation of ubiquitin chains on RIP1, leading to the caspase-8 activation and apoptosis in TNF-α-treated TNBC cells.  This may be valuable for the development of cancer therapy.

"[SOC]###context:  flavivirus NS5 harbors a methyltransferase (MTase) in its N-terminal ≈ 265 residues and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) within the C-terminal part.  One of the major interests and challenges in NS5 is to understand the interplay between RdRP and MTase as a unique natural fusion protein in viral genome replication and cap formation.  Here, we report the first crystal structure of the full-length flavivirus NS5 from Japanese encephalitis virus.   (DENV) nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) is composed of two globular domains separated by a 10-residue linker.  The N-terminal domain participates in the synthesis of a mRNA cap 1 structure ((7Me)GpppA(2'OMe)) at the 5' end of the viral genome and possesses guanylyltransferase, guanine-N7-methyltransferase, and nucleoside-2'O-methyltransferase activities.  The C-terminal domain is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase responsible for viral RNA synthesis.  Although crystal structures of the two isolated domains have been obtained, there are no structural data for full-length NS5.  It is also unclear whether the two NS5 domains interact with each other to form a stable structure in which the relative orientation of the two domains is fixed.  To investigate the structure and dynamics of DENV type 3 NS5 in solution, we conducted small-angle X-ray scattering experiments with the full-length protein.  NS5 was found to be monomeric and well-folded under the conditions tested.  West Nile virus (WNV) NS5 protein contains a methyltransferase (MTase) domain involved in RNA capping and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain essential for virus replication.  Crystal structures of individual WNV MTase and RdRp domains have been solved; however, the structure of full-length NS5 has not been determined.  To gain more insight into the structure of NS5 and interactions between the MTase and RdRp domains, we generated a panel of seven monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the NS5 protein of WNV (Kunjin strain) and mapped their binding sites using a series of truncated NS5 proteins and synthetic peptides.  Binding sites of four mAbs (5D4, 4B6, 5C11 and 6A10) were mapped to residues 354-389 in the fingers subdomain of the RdRp.  This is consistent with the ability of these mAbs to inhibit RdRp activity in vitro and suggests that this region represents a potential target for RdRp inhibitors.  Using a series of synthetic peptides, we also identified a linear epitope (bound by mAb 5H1) that mapped to a 13 aa stretch surrounding residues 47 and 49 in the MTase domain, a region predicted to interact with the palm subdomain of the RdRp.  The failure of one mAb (7G6) to bind both N- and C-terminally truncated NS5 recombinants indicates that the antibody recognizes a conformational epitope that requires the presence of residues in both the MTase and RdRp domains.

"[SOC]###context: ERAP1-ERAP2 dimerization increases peptide-trimming efficiency.  In this study, we produced stabilized ERAP1-ERAP2 heterodimers and found that they produced several mature epitopes more efficiently than a mix of the two enzymes unable to dimerize.  Physical interaction with ERAP2 changes basic enzymatic parameters of ERAP1 and improves its substrate-binding affinity.  Thus, by bringing the two enzymes in proximity and by producing allosteric effects on ERAP1, dimerization of ERAP1/2 creates complexes with superior peptide-trimming efficacy.  Such complexes are likely to enhance Ag presentation by cells displaying coordinated expression of the two enzymes.  In this study, we produced stabilized ERAP1-ERAP2 heterodimers and found that they produced several mature epitopes more efficiently than a mix of the two enzymes unable to dimerize.  Formation of heterodimers by ERAP1 and ERAP2 has been proposed to facilitate trimming of epitope precursor peptides, but the effects of dimerization on ERAP function remain unknown.

"[SOC]###context: The Aux/IAA proteins are auxin-sensitive repressors that mediate diverse physiological and developmental processes in plants [1, 2].  There are 29 Aux/IAA genes in Arabidopsis that exhibit unique but partially overlapping patterns of expression Plant Stress Tolerance Requires Auxin-Sensitive Aux/IAA Transcriptional Repressors Several DREB/CBF TFs directly promote transcription of the IAA5 and IAA19 genes in response to abiotic stress.   Here, we systematically dissect auxin sensing by SCFTIR1-IAA6 and SCFTIR1-IAA19 co-receptor complexes, and assess IAA6/IAA19 ubiquitylation in vitro and IAA6/IAA19 degradation in vivo.  We showed that EgrIAA4 protein is localized in the nucleus and functions as an auxin-responsive repressor.  Auxin-induced, SCF(TIR1)-mediated poly-ubiquitination marks AUX/IAA proteins for degradation.  evidence for SCF(TIR1)-mediated ubiquitination of the Aux/IAA proteins SHY2/IAA3 and BDL/IAA12 Auxin enhances the binding of Aux/IAA proteins to the receptor TIR1, which is an F-box protein that is part of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex SCF(TIR1).  Binding of Aux/IAA proteins leads to degradation via the 26S proteasome, but evidence for SCF(TIR1)-mediated poly-ubiquitination of Aux/IAA proteins is lacking The tomato Aux/IAA transcription factor IAA9 is involved in fruit development and leaf morphogenesis We report here that the downregulation of IAA9, a tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) gene from a distinct subfamily of Aux/IAA genes, results in a pleiotropic phenotype, consistent with its ubiquitous expression pattern Auxin dose-response assays revealed that IAA9 downregulated lines were hypersensitive to auxin, although the only early auxin-responsive gene that was found to be upregulated in the antisense lines was IAA3 The activity of the IAA3 promoter was stimulated in the IAA9 antisense genetic background, indicating that IAA9 acts in planta as a transcriptional repressor of auxin signaling.  While no mutation in any member of subfamily IV has been reported to date, the phenotypes associated with the downregulation of IAA9 reveal distinct and novel roles for members of the Aux/IAA gene family.  Aux/IAA proteins are short-lived nuclear proteins that repress expression of primary/early auxin response genes in protoplast transfection assays.  AUX/IAA proteins are active repressors, and their stability and activity are modulated by auxin.  The Aux/IAA proteins are auxin-sensitive repressors that mediate diverse physiological and developmental processes in plants [1, 2].  There are 29 Aux/IAA genes in Arabidopsis that exhibit unique but partially overlapping patterns of expression [3].  Functional characterization of SlIAA15, a member of the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) Functional characterization of SlIAA15, a member of the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) Aux/IAA family, shows that the encoded protein acts as a strong repressor of auxin-dependent transcription.  The Aux/IAA genes are best characterized among the early auxin-responsive genes, which encode short-lived transcriptional repressors.  plant stress tolerance requires auxin sensitive aux iaa transcriptional repressors genome wide analysis and characterization of aux iaa family genes in brassica rapa the aux iaa proteins are auxin sensitive repressors that mediate diverse physiological and developmental processes in plants 1 2 there are 29 aux iaa genes in arabidopsis that exhibit unique but partially overlapping patterns of expression 3 although some studies have suggested that individual aux iaa genes have specialized function genetic analyses of the family have been limited by the scarcity of loss of function phenotypes 4 furthermore with a few exceptions our knowledge of the factors that regulate aux iaa expression is limited 1 5 we hypothesize that transcriptional control of aux iaa genes plays a central role in the establishment of the auxin signaling pathways that regulate organogenesis growth and environmental response here we describe a screen for transcription factors tfs that regulate the aux iaa genes we identify tfs from 38 families including 26 members of the dreb cbf family several dreb cbf tfs directly promote transcription of the iaa5 and iaa19 genes in response to abiotic stress recessive mutations in these iaa genes result in decreased tolerance to stress conditions demonstrating a role for auxin in abiotic stress our results demonstrate that stress pathways interact with the auxin gene regulatory network grn through transcription of the aux iaa genes we propose that the aux iaa genes function as hubs that integrate genetic and environmental information to achieve the appropriate developmental or physiological outcome.  auxin is a central hormone that exerts pleiotropic effects on plant growth including the development of roots shoots flowers and fruit the perception and signaling of the plant hormone auxin rely on the cooperative action of several components among which auxin indole 3 acetic acid aux iaa proteins play a pivotal role in this study we identified and comprehensively analyzed the entire aux iaa gene family in tomato solanum lycopersicum a reference species for solanaceae plants and the model plant for fleshy fruit development functional characterization using a dedicated single cell system revealed that tomato aux iaa proteins function as active repressors of auxin dependent gene transcription with however different aux iaa members displaying varying levels of repression phylogenetic analysis indicated that the aux iaa gene family is slightly contracted in tomato compared with arabidopsis with a lower representation of non canonical proteins sl iaa genes display distinctive expression pattern in different tomato organs and tissues and some of them display differential responses to auxin and ethylene suggesting that aux iaas may play a role in linking both hormone signaling pathways the data presented here shed more light on sl iaa genes and provides new leads towards the elucidation of their function during plant development and in mediating hormone cross talk.  the aux iaa genes encode a large family of short lived proteins known to regulate auxin signalling in plants functional characterization of sliaa15 a member of the tomato solanum lycopersicum aux iaa family shows that the encoded protein acts as a strong repressor of auxin dependent transcription the physiological significance of sliaa15 was addressed by a reverse genetics approach revealing that sliaa15 plays multiple roles in plant developmental processes the sliaa15 down regulated lines display lower trichome number reduced apical dominance with associated modified pattern of axillary shoot development increased lateral root formation and decreased fruit set moreover the leaves of sliaa15 inhibited plants are dark green and thick with larger pavement cells longer palisade cells and larger intercellular space of spongy mesophyll cells the sliaa15 suppressed plants exhibit a strong reduction in type i v and vi trichome formation suggesting that auxin dependent transcriptional regulation is required for trichome initiation concomitant with reduced trichome formation the expression of some r2r3 myb genes putatively involved in the control of trichome differentiation is altered these phenotypes uncover novel and specialized roles for aux iaas in plant developmental processes clearly indicating that members of the aux iaa gene family in tomato perform both overlapping and specific functions.  auxins are the key players in plant growth development involving leaf formation phototropism root fruit and embryo development auxin indole 3 acetic acid aux iaa are early auxin response genes noted as transcriptional repressors in plant auxin signaling however many studies focus on aux arf gene families and much less is known about the aux iaa

using genebank b rapa ests and in home developed microarray data from mature leaves of chiifu and rcbr lines despite their huge morphological difference tissue specific expression analysis of briaa genes between the parental lines chiifu and rcbr showed that the genes followed a similar pattern of expression during leaf development and a different pattern during bud flower and siliqua development stages the response of the briaa genes to abiotic and auxin stress at different time intervals revealed their involvement in stress response single nucleotide polymorphisms between iaa genes of reference genome chiifu and rcbr were focused and identified our study examines the scope of conservation and divergence of aux iaa genes and their structures in b rapa analyzing the expression and structural variation between two parental lines will significantly contribute to functional genomics of brassica crops and we belive our study would provide a foundation in understanding the aux iaa genes in b rapa.  the plant hormone auxin plays a central role in regulating many aspects of plant growth and development this largely occurs as a consequence of changes in gene expression the aux iaa genes are best characterized among the early auxin responsive genes which encode short lived transcriptional repressors in most plants examined including arabidopsis soybean and rice the aux iaa genes constitute a large gene family by screening the available databases at least 15 expressed sequence tags ests have been identified from wheat triticum aestivum which exhibit high sequence identity with aux iaa homologues in other species one of these aux iaa genes taiaa1 harbouring all the four conserved domains characteristic of the aux iaa proteins has been characterized in detail the expression of taiaa1 is light sensitive tissue specific and is induced within 15 30 min of exogenous auxin application also the taiaa1 transcript levels increase in the presence of a divalent cation ca 2 and this effect is reversed by the calcium chelating agent egta the taiaa1 gene qualifies as the primary response gene because an increase in its transcript levels by auxin is unaffected by cycloheximide in addition to auxin the taiaa1 gene is also induced by brassinosteroid providing evidence that interplay between hormones is crucial for the regulation of plant growth and development.  auxin regulates various aspects of plant growth and development the auxin indole 3 acetic acid aux iaa genes encode short lived transcriptional repressors that are targeted by the transport inhibitor response1 auxin receptor f box proteins the aux iaa proteins regulate auxin mediated gene expression by interacting with members of the auxin response factor protein family aux iaa function is poorly understood herein we report the identification and characterization of insertion mutants in 12 of the 29 aux iaa family members the mutants show no visible developmental defects compared with the wild type double or triple mutants of closely related aux iaa genes such as iaa8 1 iaa9 1 or iaa5 1 iaa6 1 iaa19 1 also exhibit wild type phenotypes global gene expression analysis reveals that the molecular phenotypes of auxin treated and untreated light grown seedlings are unaffected in the iaa17 6 and iaa5 1 iaa6 1 iaa19 1 mutants by contrast similar analysis with the gain of function axr3 1 iaa17 1 mutant seedlings reveals dramatic changes in basal and auxin induced gene expression compared with the wild type expression of several type a arabidopsis response regulator genes and a number of genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis and degradation is repressed in axr3 1 iaa17 1 the data suggest extensive functional redundancy among aux iaa gene family members and that enhanced stability of the axr3 iaa17 protein severely alters the molecular phenotype resulting in developmental defects.  the regulatory interactions between auxin response factors arfs and aux iaa repressors play a central role in auxin signal transduction yet the systems properties of this regulatory network are not well established we generated a steroid inducible arf5 monopteros mp transgenic background to survey the involvement of this factor in the transcriptional regulation of the entire aux iaa family in arabidopsis thaliana target genes of arf5 mp identified by this approach were confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation in vitro gel retardation assays and gene expression analyses our study shows that arf5 mp is indispensable for the correct regulation of nearly one half of all aux iaa genes and that these targets coincide with distinct subclades further genetic analyses demonstrate that the protein products of multiple aux iaa targets negatively feed back onto arf5 mp activity this work indicates that arf5 mp broadly influences the expression of the aux iaa gene family and suggests that such regulation involves the activation of specific subsets of redundantly functioning factors these groups of factors may then act together to control various processes within the plant through negative feedback on arf5 similar detailed analyses of other aux iaa arf regulatory modules will be required to fully understand how auxin signal transduction influences virtually every aspect of plant growth and development.  a well known physiological adaptation process of plants encountering drying soil is to achieve water balance by reducing shoot growth and maintaining or promoting root elongation but little is known about the molecular basis of this process this study investigated the role of a drought up regulated triticum aestivum nac69 1 tanac69 1 in the modulation of root growth in wheat tanac69 1 was predominantly expressed in wheat roots at the early vegetative stage overexpression of tanac69 1 in wheat roots using osrsp3 essentially root specific and ospip2 3 root predominant promoters resulted in enhanced primary seminal root length and a marked increase in maturity root biomass competitive growth analysis under water limited conditions showed that osrsp3 promoter driven tanac69 1 transgenic lines produced 32 and 35 more above ground biomass and grains than wild type plants respectively tanac69 1 overexpression in the roots down regulated the expression of tashy2 and taiaa7 which are from the auxin iaa aux iaa transcriptional repressor gene family and are the homologs of negative root growth regulators shy2 iaa3 and iaa7 in arabidopsis the expression of tashy2 and taiaa7 in roots was down regulated by drought stress and up regulated by cytokinin treatment which inhibited root growth dna binding and transient expression analyses revealed that tanac69 1 bound to the promoters of tashy2 and taiaa7 acted as a transcriptional repressor and repressed the expression of reporter genes driven by the tashy2 or taiaa7 promoter these data suggest that tanac69 1 is a transcriptional repressor of tashy2 and taiaa7 homologous to arabidopsis negative root growth regulators and is likely to be involved in promoting root elongation in drying soil.  auxin mediates numerous plant responses some of which have been shown to require transcriptional regulation one auxin response pathway which depends on the relief of transcriptional repression is mediated by tir1 transport inhibitor response protein 1 tir1 is an auxin receptor and also a subunit of an scf type ubiquitin ligase in the presence of a low concentration of auxin in the nucleus members of the aux iaa family of transcriptional repressors bind to arf proteins and inhibit the transcription of specific auxin response genes increased nuclear concentrations of auxin promote auxin binding to tir1 causing the aux iaa proteins to associate with tir1 and leading to their degradation by a proteasome mediated pathway this decreases the concentration of aux iaa proteins in the nucleus and thereby enables the expression of certain auxin response genes.  recent studies of auxin response have focused on the functions of three sets of proteins the auxin aux response factors arfs the aux iaas and the f box protein tir1 the arf proteins bind dna and directly activate or repress transcription of target genes while the aux iaa proteins repress arf function tir1 is part of a ubiquitin protein ligase required for degradation of aux iaa proteins here we report the isolation and characterization of a novel mutant of arabidopsis called axr5 1 mutant plants are resistant to auxin and display a variety of auxin related growth defects including defects in root and shoot tropisms further the axr5 1 mutation results in a decrease in auxin regulated transcription the molecular cloning of axr5 revealed that the gene encodes the iaa1 protein a member of the aux iaa family of proteins axr5 is expressed throughout plant development consistent with the pleiotropic mutant phenotype the axr5 1 mutation results in an amino acid substitution in conserved domain ii of the protein similar to gain of function mutations recovered in other members of this gene family biochemical studies show that iaa1 axr5 interacts with tir1 in an auxin dependent manner the mutation prevents this interaction suggesting that the mutant phenotype is caused by the accumulation of iaa1 axr5 our results provide further support for a model in which most members of the aux iaa family are targeted for degradation by scftir1 in response to auxin.

"[SOC]###context:  Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a collection of clinical conditions, including central obesity, hypertension, glucose intolerance and dyslipidemia.  Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is generally defined as a cluster of metabolically related cardiovascular risk factors which are often associated with the condition of insulin resistance, elevated blood pressure, and abdominal obesity Metabolic syndrome, defined as a cluster of obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance/glucose intolerance, has been identified as a major risk factor for coronary heart disease in women.  Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions that synergistically increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and premature mortality.  The components are abdominal obesity, impaired glucose metabolism, dyslipidemia, and hypertension.  MetS is recognized clinically by numerous constitutive traits, including abdominal obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia (elevated triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), and hyperglycemia.   Abdominal obesity is frequently associated with a collection of metabolic disorders that include elevated blood pressure, characteristic lipid abnormalities (low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high triglycerides) and increased fasting glucose, with an underlying situation of insulin resistance, which has been defined as metabolic syndrome The presence of 3 or more of the following 5 components (abdominal obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, low level of high density lipoprotein cholesterol, hypertension and high fasting blood glucose) allows to diagnose metabolic syndrome.  The metabolic syndrome has 5 criteria: central obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, fasting hyperglycemia, and hypertension.  Metabolic syndrome is a constellation of interrelated risk factors of metabolic origin including abdominal obesity, atherogenic dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure, elevated plasma glucose level, and prothrombotic and proinflammatory states that promote atherosclerotic CVD and increase the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus.  The waist circumference cut points for diagnosing metabolic syndrome (as defined using the new harmonised guidelines), insulin resistance, dysglycaemia, hypertension and dyslipidaemia were obtained using receiver operator characteristic curve analysis.  The metabolic syndrome is a complex association of several risk factors including insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and essential hypertension.    insulin resistance syndrome (often referred to as syndrome X or the metabolic syndrome) ie, a clustering of metabolic, atheromatous risk factors, including hypertriglyceridaemia, hyperinsulinaemia, hyper-tension, hypercholesterinaemia and obesity.   The metabolic syndrome is a clustering of risk factors which predispose an individual to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.  There is general consensus regarding the main components of the syndrome (glucose intolerance, obesity, raised blood pressure and dyslipidaemia [elevated triglycerides, low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol])  Metabolic syndrome (MS) refers to the clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors - including abdominal obesity, hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia and elevated blood pressure The metabolic syndrome is a constellation of risk factors including glucose dysregulation, central obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension.  Insulin resistance syndrome (IRS), also termed syndrome X, is a distinctive constellation of risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease.  The syndrome's hallmarks are glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, a characteristic dyslipidemia (high triglycerides; low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and small, dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), obesity, upper-body fat distribution, hypertension, and increased prothrombotic and antifibrinolytic factors ""The metabolic syndrome"" is the name for a clustering of risk factors for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes that are of metabolic origin.  These risk factors consist of atherogenic dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure, elevated plasma glucose, a prothrombotic state, and a proinflammatory state.   Metabolic Syndrome X is a clinical entity which comprises the following factors: diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, high levels of triglyceride and/or low levels of HDL cholesterol, central obesity and microalbuminuria metabolic syndrome, produced by genetic, hormonal and lifestyle factors such as obesity, physical inactivity and certain nutrient excesses.

"[SOC]###context: Mechanism of action of flibanserin, a multifunctional serotonin agonist and antagonist (MSAA), in hypoactive sexual desire disorder.  Flibanserin is a novel multifunctional serotonin agonist and antagonist (MSAA) that improves sexual functioning in premenopausal women who suffer from reduced sexual interest and desire.  Flibanserin is a novel, non-hormonal drug for the treatment of HSDD in pre- and postmenopausal women, although the application submitted to the U. S.  Food and Drug Administration by Sprout Pharmaceuticals is only for premenopausal women.  CONCLUSIONS: In naturally postmenopausal women with HSDD, flibanserin, compared with placebo, has been associated with improvement in sexual desire, improvement in the number of SSEs, and reduced distress associated with low sexual desire, and is well tolerated.  INTRODUCTION: Flibanserin is a mixed 5-HT1A agonist/5-HT2A antagonist that has been developed for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women BACKGROUND: Flibanserin, a novel serotonin (5-HT)(1A) agonist and 5-HT(2A) antagonist, has been shown to increase sexual desire and reduce distress in women with Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD).   Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) is the most commonly described form of female sexual dysfunction.  There is currently no pharmacological therapy approved to treat HSDD, and therefore, there is an unmet medical need for the development of efficacious treatment alternatives.  Flibanserin is a novel, non-hormonal drug for the treatment of HSDD in pre- and postmenopausal women, although the application submitted to the U. S.   Sexual function adverse events across flibanserin groups were generally comparable to placebo. Although these studies were not designed or powered to compare sexual function outcomes, results suggested a potential benefit of flibanserin on sexual function, particularly on female sexual desire, and provided a rationale to evaluate the efficacy of flibanserin as a treatment for female hypoactive sexual desire disorder.

(2014) bring microRNAs and chromatin together by showing how activation-induced miR-155 targets the chromatin protein Jarid2 to regulate proinflammatory cytokine production in T helper 17 cells.  miR-155 activates cytokine gene expression in Th17 cells by regulating the DNA-binding protein Jarid2 to relieve polycomb-mediated repression.  Mir155 was bound by Th17 cell transcription factors and was highly expressed during Th17 cell differentiation.  miR-155-deficient Th17 and T regulatory (Treg) cells expressed increased amounts of Jarid2, a DNA-binding protein that recruits the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) to chromatin.  PRC2 binding to chromatin and H3K27 histone methylation was increased in miR-155-deficient cells, coinciding with failure to express Il22, Il10, Il9, and Atf3.  Defects in Th17 cell cytokine expression and Treg cell homeostasis in the absence of Mir155 could be partially suppressed by Jarid2 deletion.  Thus, miR-155 contributes to Th17 cell function by suppressing the inhibitory effects of Jarid2.  Thus, miR-155 contributes to Th17 cell function by suppressing the inhibitory effects of Jarid2.

"[SOC]###context: Rett syndrome (RTT) results from loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) and is characterized by abnormal motor, respiratory and autonomic control, cognitive impairment, autistic-like behaviors and increased risk of seizures.   Rett syndrome (RTT) is an autism spectrum disorder caused by mutation in the gene encoding methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2).  Severely arrhythmic breathing is a hallmark of Rett syndrome (RTT) and profoundly affects quality of life for patients and their families.  The last decade has seen the identification of the disease-causing gene, methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (Mecp2) and the development of mouse models that phenocopy many aspects of the human syndrome, including breathing dysfunction.  Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests in females, typically after the first year of life.  It was recently discovered that RTT is caused by mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene.  MECP2 assists in the transcriptional silencing process via DNA methylation; we hypothesize that disruption of this gene alters the normal developmental expression of various other genes, some of which must account for the peculiar neurologic phenotype of RTT.  Molecular studies have identified MECP2 mutations in up to 80% of classic RTT patients; mutation type has some effect on the phenotypic manifestation of RTT, but the pattern of X inactivation seems to determine phenotypic severity.

A corrected creatinine was derived from the mGFR after application of the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula.  Subsequently, a corrected MELD was calculated and compared with the conventionally calculated MELD.  Among patients with MELD score>35, a new prognostic model based on serum creatinine, need for hemodialysis and moderate ascites could identify the sickest one.  Patient risk factors evaluated include age, INR (international normalized ratio), creatinine, bilirubin, and MELD score (Model for End-of-stage Liver Disease).   Limited comparability of creatinine assays in patients with liver cirrhosis and their impact on the MELD score.  The model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) score is used for this purpose in most countries and incorporates bilirubin, International Normalized ratio, and creatinine.   The MELD score was calculated using international normalized ratio, serum billirubin and creatinine.  Regression analysis identified high creatinine and INR, but not bilirubin, as the MELD components predicting negative outcomes with ELAD.   This study aimed to evaluate the impact of two creatinine measurement methods on the Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score and glomerular filtration rate estimation (eGFR) in cirrhotic patients.  <b>OBJECTIVES</b>: The model for end-stage liver disease score (MELD = 3. 8*LN[total bilirubin] + 9. 6*LN[creatinine] + 11. 2*[PT-INR] + 6. 4) predicts mortality for tricuspid valve surgery.

"[SOC]###context: OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to comprehensively assess mRNA expression of 84 drug transporters in human colorectal biopsies and six representative cell lines, and to investigate the alteration of drug transporter gene expression after exposure to three candidate microbicidal antiretroviral (ARV) drugs (tenofovir, darunavir and dapivirine) in the colorectal epithelium.  The outcome of the objectives informs development of optimal ARV-based microbicidal formulations for prevention of HIV-1 infection.  We evaluated the adherence and acceptability of a vaginal ring containing dapivirine, maraviroc, or both drugs for 28 days during a Phase I placebo-controlled trial in 48 HIV-negative sexually abstinent U. S.  women aged 18-40.  Use of a Vaginal Ring Containing Dapivirine for HIV-1 Prevention in Women.  Methods We conducted a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a monthly vaginal ring containing dapivirine, a non-nucleoside HIV-1 reverse-transcriptase inhibitor, involving women between the ages of 18 and 45 years in Malawi, South Africa, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.  Results Among the 2629 women who were enrolled, 168 HIV-1 infections occurred: 71 in the dapivirine group and 97 in the placebo group (incidence, 3. 3 and 4. 5 per 100 person-years, respectively).  The incidence of HIV-1 infection in the dapivirine group was lower by 27% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1 to 46; P=0. 05) than that in the placebo group.  In an analysis that excluded data from two sites that had reduced rates of retention and adherence, the incidence of HIV-1 infection in the dapivirine group was lower by 37% (95% CI, 12 to 56; P=0. 007) than that in the placebo group.  Conclusions A monthly vaginal ring containing dapivirine reduced the risk of HIV-1 infection among African women, with increased efficacy in subgroups with evidence of increased adherence.   BACKGROUND: This was the first microbicide trial conducted in Africa to evaluate an antiretroviral-containing vaginal ring as an HIV prevention technology for women. OBJECTIVES: The trial assessed and compared the safety, acceptability and adherence to product use of a 4-weekly administered vaginal ring containing the antiretroviral microbicide, dapivirine, with a matching placebo ring among women from four countries in sub-Saharan Africa.  CONCLUSIONS: The dapivirine vaginal ring has a favourable safety and acceptability profile.  If proven safe and effective in large-scale trials, it will be an important component of combination HIV prevention approaches for women.  PURPOSE: To develop polymeric films containing dual combinations of anti-HIV drug candidate tenofovir, maraviroc and dapivirine for vaginal application as topical microbicides.  Efficacy trials with a dapivirine-containing vaginal ring for HIV prevention are ongoing and plans to develop multi-purpose vaginal rings for prevention of both HIV and pregnancy have been elaborated.  Inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection by the candidate microbicide dapivirine, a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor.  The incidence of HIV-1 infection in the dapivirine group was lower by 27% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1 to 46; P=0. 046) than that in the placebo group.  In an analysis that excluded data from two sites that had reduced rates of retention and adherence, the incidence of HIV-1 infection in the dapivirine group was lower by 37% (95% CI, 12 to 56; P=0. 007) than that in the placebo group.  Within this study the in vitro bioactivity of dapivirine as compared to the NNRTI UC781 was further established and a quick dissolve film was developed for vaginal application of dapivirine for prevention of HIV infection.  Dapivirine, a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, is in development as a microbicide for the protection of women against HIV infection.  Dapivirine is a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor being developed as a topical microbicide for the prevention of human immunodeficiency virus infection.  Dapivirine from both IVRs was successfully distributed throughout the lower genital tract at concentrations>1000x the EC(50) against wild-type HIV-1 (LAI) in MT4 cells suggesting that IVR delivery of microbicides is a viable option meriting further study.  The nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors UC-781 and TMC120-R147681 (Dapivirine) effectively prevented human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in cocultures of monocyte-derived dendritic cells and T cells, representing primary targets in sexual transmission.  To assess the potential of polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) to affect the genital distribution and local and systemic pharmacokinetics (PK) of the anti-HIV microbicide drug candidate dapivirine after vaginal delivery. Dapivirine-loaded, poly(ethylene oxide)-coated poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PEO-PCL) NPs were prepared by a nanoprecipitation method The nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors UC-781 and TMC120-R147681 (Dapivirine) effectively prevented human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in cocultures of monocyte-derived dendritic cells and T cells, representing primary targets in sexual transmission Dapivirine is a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor being developed as a topical microbicide for the prevention of human immunodeficiency virus infection.   CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates proof of concept for a dapivirine-releasing diaphragm with daily release quantities potentially capable of preventing HIV transmission.   Antiretroviral-containing vaginal microbicide rings, which release medication over a month or longer, may reduce these adherence challenges. ASPIRE (A Study to Prevent Infection with a Ring for Extended Use) is a phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial testing the safety and effectiveness of a vaginal ring containing the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor dapivirine for prevention of HIV-1 infection.  Dapivirine demonstrated potent dose-dependent inhibitory effects against a broad panel of HIV type 1 isolates from different clades.  Two large efficacy trials of a vaginal ring containing the investigational drug dapivirine demonstrated efficacy and safety in preventing HIV infections in women in Africa.  In doing so, we discovered that dapivirine and maraviroc, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and an entry inhibitor currently in development as microbicides for HIV PrEP, are differentially metabolized in colorectal tissue and vaginal tissue.  Plasma dapivirine concentrations were low (<1 ng/ml) and remained well below those observed at the maximum tolerated dose for oral treatment (mean Cmax of 2286  ng/ml). CONCLUSION: The dapivirine vaginal ring has a safety and pharmacokinetic profile that supports its use as a sustained-release topical microbicide for HIV-1 prevention in women.  ASPIRE (A Study to Prevent Infection with a Ring for Extended Use) is a phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial testing the safety and effectiveness of a vaginal ring containing the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor dapivirine for prevention of HIV-1 infection.  Dual segment polyurethane intravaginal rings (IVRs) were fabricated to enable sustained release of antiretroviral agents dapivirine and tenofovir to prevent the male to female sexual transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus.  The study demonstrates proof of concept for a dapivirine-releasing diaphragm with daily release quantities potentially capable of preventing HIV transmission.

Mitochondrial fission requires the dynamin GTPase Drp1, which assembles in a ring around the mitochondrion and appears to constrict both outer and inner mitochondrial membranes.  DRP1; a mitochondrial fission protein Mitochondrial morphology is primarily controlled by the activation of dynamin-related proteins including dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), which promotes mitochondrial fission.   The change in mitochondrial morphology was caused by downregulation of the expression of Fis1 and Drp1, two proteins regulating mitochondrial fission.  Furthermore, overexpression of the fission protein Drp1 (dynamin-related protein 1) or knocking down of the fusion protein OPA1 (optical atrophy 1) suppressed PINK1 RNAi-induced mitochondrial morphological defect, and overexpression of PINK1 or Parkin suppressed the elongated mitochondria phenotype caused by Drp1 RNAi.  These results collectively indicate that ER-specific BNIP1 plays an important role in mitochondrial dynamics by modulating the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 in a BH3 domain-dependent fashion.  In the present study, we found a marked upregulation of mitochondrial fission protein dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) expression in human invasive breast carcinoma and metastases to lymph nodes.  Mitochondrial remodeling was associated with increased proximity between Rab11a and mitochondrial membranes, changes in fusion-fission dynamics, and mitochondrial relocalization of the fission factor dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), which was regulated by the Rab11a effector protein FIP1/RCP.  Functional analysis demonstrated that BNIP1 expression increased dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) expression followed by the mitochondrial translocation of Drp1 and subsequent mitochondrial fission.  Role of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)-mediated mitochondrial fission in oxygen sensing and constriction of the ductus arteriosus.

Mitochondria in DRG neurons undergo hyperglycemic mediated injury through Bim, Bax and the fission protein Drp1.  This novel function for DRP1 is distinct from its recognized role in regulating mitochondrial fission.   Abnormal interaction between the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 and hyperphosphorylated tau in Alzheimer's disease neurons: implications for mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal damage.  SUMOylation of the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 occurs at multiple nonconsensus sites within the B domain and is linked to its activity cycle.  Dynamic regulation of mitochondrial fission through modification of the dynamin-related protein Drp1.  We highlight posttranslational modifications of the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1, for which these regulatory mechanisms are best characterized.  Furthermore, overexpression of the fission protein Drp1 (dynamin-related protein 1) or knocking down of the fusion protein OPA1 (optical atrophy 1) suppressed PINK1 RNAi-induced mitochondrial morphological defect, and overexpression of PINK1 or Parkin suppressed the elongated mitochondria phenotype caused by Drp1 RNAi.  Functionally, PINK1 knockdown and overexpression had opposite effects on dendritic spine formation and neuronal vulnerability to excitotoxicity.  In this study the role of the mitochondrial fission protein, Drp1 during Shigella infection in HeLa cells was examined.

"[SOC]###context: Statins are inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid by NADPH Statins, which specifically inhibit HMG Co-A reductase, the rate-limiting step of cholesterol biosynthesis, are widely prescribed to reduce serum cholesterol and cardiac risk, OBJECTIVES: Statins are a lipid-lowering treatment, prescribed frequently to prevent cardiovascular events.  The doctors' beliefs about statins' ability to prolong life were associated significantly with their willingness to initiate treatment. CONCLUSION: The overall results imply that doctors have varying and suboptimal understanding of the effect of statins.  However, the meta-regression analysis indicated that age of study participants modified the association between statin use and cancer risk (P = . 003). CONCLUSION: Our findings do not support a protective effect of statins against cancer.  What is less well known is a phenomenon whereby statins may induce a myopathy, which persists or may progress after stopping the drug.  Statins can cause a necrotizing myopathy and hyperCKaemia which is reversible on cessation of the drug.  * Our data do not show any beneficial effect of statins in reducing disease inflammation in RA patients. AIM: To investigate the possible anti-inflammatory effect of statins in a cohort of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study consisting of all patients with at least one claim for RA using LifeLink, a health insurance claims database.  Statins are widely used in kidney transplant patients given their established benefits in the general population, however evidence favouring their use is lacking. To assess the benefits and harms of statin therapy on mortality and renal outcomes in kidney transplant recipients. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and hand searched reference lists of articles and scientific proceedings. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing statins with placebo, no treatment or other statins in kidney transplant recipients. Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data Thus, it is important to understand whether other signaling pathways that are involved in atherosclerosis could be targets of statins, and if so, whether individuals with ""overactivity"" of these pathways could benefit from statin therapy, regardless of serum cholesterol level. Statins inhibit the synthesis of isoprenoids, which are important for the function of the Rho/Rho-associated coiled-coil containing kinase (ROCK) pathway Evidence for statins in people who have had a kidney transplant were sparse and lower quality due to imprecise effect estimates and provided limited systematic evaluation of treatment harm. Statins may reduce cardiovascular events in kidney transplant recipients, although treatment effects are imprecise Statins decreased 24-hour urinary protein excretion (6 studies, 311 patients: MD -0. 73 g/24 h, 95% CI -0. 95 to -0. 52), but there was no significant improvement in creatinine clearance - a surrogate marker of renal function (11 studies, 548 patients: MD 1. 48 mL/min, 95% CI -2. 32 to 5. 28). The incidence of rhabdomyolysis, elevated liver enzymes and withdrawal rates due to adverse events (well known complications of statins use), were not significantly different between patients receiving statins and placebo. Statins significantly reduced the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in CKD patients who are not receiving renal replacement therapy.  Statins are less cost-effective when obtained at average retail prices, particularly in patients at lower CVD risk. Although statins reduce absolute CVD risk in patients with CKD, the increased risk of rhabdomyolysis, and competing risks associated with progressive CKD, partly offset these gains In this review, we debate the relative effect of statins in driving insulin resistance and the impairment of insulin secretion. Narrative overview of the literature synthesizing the findings of literature was retrieved from searches of computerized databases, hand searches, and authoritative texts employing the key words ""Statins"", ""Randomized Clinical Trial"", ""Insulin sensitivity"", ""Insulin resistance"", ""Insulin Secretion"", ""Diabetes Mellitus"" alone and/or in combination. The weight of clinical evidence suggests a worsening effect of statins on insulin resistance and secretion, anyway basic science studies did not find a clear molecular explanation, providing conflicting evidence regarding both the beneficial and the adverse effects of statin therapy on insulin sensitivity.  This study was undertaken to investigate the immunomodulatory mechanisms of statins that target the IFN response in PDCs. We isolated human blood PDCs by flow cytometry and examined the effects of simvastatin and pitavastatin on PDC activation, IFNalpha production, and intracellular signaling. Statins inhibited IFNalpha production profoundly and tumor necrosis factor alpha production modestly in human PDCs in response to Toll-like receptor ligands The earlier JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention) trial provided appealing evidence that the risk of venous thrombosis may be lowered by statins Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) decrease postoperative adhesions by increasing peritoneal fibrinolytic activity.  Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) reduce CD40 expression in human vascular cells.  HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) activate expression of PPARalpha/PPARgamma and ABCA1 in cultured gallbladder epithelial cells.  HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) might cause high elevations of creatine phosphokinase (CK) in patients with unnoticed hypothyroidism.  HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) reduce hypertrophic scar formation in a rabbit ear wounding model.  HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, statins, induce phosphorylation of Mdm2 and attenuate the p53 response to DNA damage.  The target for statins, HMG-CoA reductase, is expressed in ductal carcinoma-in situ and may predict patient response to radiotherapy.  Two meta-analyses have shown statins do not improve survival, whereas two others showed improved cardiac function and reduced inflammation in HF.  It appears lipophilic statins produce better survival and other outcome benefits compared to hydrophilic statins.  Statins are the current basis of lipid-lowering therapy, despite which may have limitations on efficacy and safety.  In high risk patients who do not achieve current lipid goals, in those intolerant to statins or those with atherogenic dyslipidemia, it is possible combine two or more lipid lowering drugs, including statins, ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, fibrates, niacin and prescription omega-3 fatty acids.

However, for most of these combination therapies pivotal data on clinical outcomes are still lacking.  Statins are the current basis of lipid-lowering therapy, despite which may have limitations on efficacy and safety.  However, the findings of two large RCTs do not support the evidence provided by previous studies and suggest statins lack beneficial effects in HF.  Subsequently, a number of nonrandomised studies have shown statins improve clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF).  AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Statins have shown broad spectrum anti-cancer properties in laboratory studies.  Statin-induced myopathy is an important cause of statin intolerance and the most common cause of statin discontinuation.  These findings underscore the need to better define the pathophysiology of statin-induced myalgia and develop methodologies to guide treatment of statin-intolerant patients. .

"[SOC]###context:  The C-terminus plays an important role in targeting TSPO to mitochondria, whereas its import into the OMM is dependent upon the presence of the Schellman motif.  Final integration of TSPO into the OMM occurs via its interaction with Metaxin 1.   TOM20 (translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane), METAXIN, and mtOM64 (outer mitochondrial membrane protein of 64 kD).   The outer membrane protein METAXIN was characterized to play a role in the import of mitochondrial precursor proteins and likely plays a role in the assembly of beta-barrel proteins into the outer membrane.  The mitochondrial inner membrane protein mitofilin exists as a complex with SAM50, metaxins 1 and 2, coiled-coil-helix coiled-coil-helix domain-containing protein 3 and 6 and DnaJC11.   The functional role of this new complex is uncertain.  However, a role in protein import related to maintenance of mitochondrial structure is suggested as mitofilin helps regulate mitochondrial morphology and at least four of the associated proteins (metaxins 1 and 2, SAM50 and CHCHD3) have been implicated in protein import, while DnaJC11 is a chaperone-like protein that may have a similar role.  We conclude that the pathway of VDAC biogenesis in human mitochondria involves the TOM complex, Sam50 and metaxins, and that it is evolutionarily conserved.  Functional analysis of human metaxin in mitochondrial protein import in cultured cells and its relationship with the Tom complex.  Metaxin is an outer membrane protein of mammalian mitochondria which is suggested to be involved in protein import into the organelle.  Metaxin 1 interacts with metaxin 2, a novel related protein associated with the mammalian mitochondrial outer membrane.  In subcellular fractions of mouse liver, a 29 kD immunoreactive protein, consistent in size with the predicted translation product of metaxin 2 cDNA, was found solely in mitochondria.   .

In the present pilot, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study, we investigated the efficacy and safety of TRH as a treatment for CF.  TRH administration was associated with significant improvement in fatigue level as measured by the VAS-E, the fatigue and vigor subscales of the POMS, and the fatigue subscale of FACIT-F (p < 0. 05).   TRH administration was efficacious, safe, and tolerable in the treatment of CF with a positive impact on quality of life.  These results provide a crucial impetus for pursuing TRH therapeutics to treat CF.  Thyrotropin-releasing hormone can relieve cancer-related fatigue: hypothesis and preliminary observations.

In this report, we demonstrate that systemic administration of an NK3R antagonist (ESN364) prolongs the LH interpulse interval in ovarectomized ewes and significantly lowers plasma LH and FSH concentrations in castrated nonhuman primates (Macaca fascicularis).  Moreover, daily oral dosing of ESN364 throughout the menstrual cycle in M fascicularis lowered plasma estradiol levels in a dose-dependent manner, although nadir levels of estradiol were maintained well above menopausal levels.  Nevertheless, estradiol levels during the follicular phase were sufficiently inhibited at all doses to preclude the triggering of ovulation as evidenced by the absence of the LH surge and failure of a subsequent luteal phase rise in plasma progesterone concentrations, consistent with the absence of normal cycle changes in the uterus.  Apart from the point at surge, FSH levels were not altered over the course of the menstrual cycle.  These effects of ESN364 were reversible upon cessation of drug treatment.  The NK3 Receptor Antagonist ESN364 Suppresses Sex Hormones in Men and Women.  ESN364 was well-tolerated and rapidly bioavailable with linear pharmacokinetics and no drug accumulation with repeated, daily oral administration.  Drug treatment dose-dependently decreased basal LH, but not FSH, and consequently decreased estradiol and progesterone (in women) as well as testosterone (in men).  The hormonal changes in women corresponded to delayed ovulation, decreased endometrial thickening, impeded follicular maturation, and prolongation of the menstrual cycle.  Drug effects were rapidly reversible.   Oral administration of the NK3R antagonist, ESN364, suppressed the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in healthy volunteers by selective modulation of gonadotropin secretion, leading to a restrained decrease in ovarian hormone levels in women.  These results suggest that ESN364 may offer therapeutic benefit in the treatment of women's health disorders with a mitigated risk of menopausal-like adverse events.

"[SOC]###context: We compared the suppressive effect of K201 (JTV519), a multiple-channel blocker and cardiac ryanodine receptor-calcium release channel (RyR2) stabilizer, with that of diltiazem, a Ca(2+ )channel blocker, in 2 studies of isoproterenol-induced (n = 30) and ischemic-reperfusion-induced VAs (n = 38) in rats.   After administration of isoproterenol under Ca(2+) loading, fatal VA frequently occurred in the vehicle (9 of 10 animals, 90%) and diltiazem (8 of 10, 80%) groups, and K201 significantly suppressed the incidences of arrhythmia and mortality (2 of 10, 20%).  In the reperfusion study, the incidence and the time until occurrence of reperfusion-induced VA and mortality were significantly suppressed in the K201 (2 of 15 animals, 13%) and diltiazem (1 of 9 animals, 11%) groups compared to the vehicle group (8 of 14 animals, 57%).   K201 markedly suppressed both the isoproterenol-induced and the reperfusion-induced VAs, whereas diltiazem did not suppress the isoproterenol-induced VA.  JTV519 (K201) is a newly developed 1,4-benzothiazepine drug with antiarrhythmic and cardioprotective properties.  It appears to be very effective in not only preventing but also in reversing the characteristic myocardial changes and preventing lethal arrhythmias.  The novel antiarrhythmic drug K201 (4-[3-{1-(4-benzyl)piperidinyl}propionyl]-7-methoxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,4-benzothiazepine monohydrochloride) is currently in development for treatment of atrial fibrillation.  K201 not only controls intracellular calcium release by the ryanodine receptors, but also possesses a ventricular action that might predispose to torsade de pointes arrhythmias.   The RyR is currently used as a therapeutic target in malignant hyperthermia where dantrolene is effective and to relieve ventricular arrhythmia, with the use of JTV519 and flecainide.  Finally, KN-3 and JTV519, two compounds that stabilize RyR2 in the closed state, prevent the induction of triggered activity and suppress the inducibility of sustained AF.   JTV-519 greatly reduced the frequency of ouabain-induced arrhythmogenic events.  Stabilization of RyR2 by JTV-519 effectively reduces these triggered arrhythmias.  These findings may reveal the anti-arrhythmic potential of K201.  The preferential ryanodine receptor stabilizer (K201) possesses antiarrhythmic effects through calcium regulation.   The drug K201 (JTV-519) increases inotropy and suppresses arrhythmias in failing hearts, but the effects of K201 on normal hearts is unknown.   K201 fails to prevent DADs in RyR2(R4496C+/-) myocytes and ventricular arrhythmias in RyR2(R4496C+/-) mice In vivo administration of K201 failed to prevent induction of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) in RyR2(R4496C+/-) mice.  The 1,4-benzothiazepine JTV519, which increases the binding affinity of calstabin-2 for RyR2, inhibited the diastolic SR Ca2+ leak, monophasic action potential alternans and triggered arrhythmias.  In arrhythmias, the calstabin2 stabiliser JTV519 did not prevent arrhythmias in calstabin2-/- mice, but reduced the arrhythmias in calstabin2+/- mice, illustrating the antiarrhythmic potential of stabilising calstablin2.   In three models of arrhythmias, the calstabin2 stabiliser JTV519 did not prevent arrhythmias in calstabin2(-/-) mice, but reduced the arrhythmias in calstabin2(+/-) mice, illustrating the antiarrhythmic potential of stabilising calstabin2.   A derivative of 1,4-benzothiazepine (JTV519) increased the affinity of calstabin2 for RyR2, which stabilized the closed state of RyR2 and prevented the Ca2+ leak that triggers arrhythmias.   JTV-519 had significant protective effects on atrial fibrillation in the canine sterile pericarditis model, mainly by increasing effective refractory period, suggesting that it may have potential as a novel antiarrhythmic agent for atrial fibrillation.  JTV-519 significantly decreased the mean number of sustained atrial fibrillation episodes (from 4. 2 +/- 2. 9 to 0 +/- 0, P < 0. 01).   We conclude that JTV-519 can exert antiarrhythmic effects against AF by inhibiting repolarizing K(+) currents.  The drug may be useful for the treatment of AF in patients with ischaemic heart disease.

"[SOC]###context: The DNA non-homologous end-joining repair gene XRCC6/Ku70 plays an important role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by both exogenous and endogenous DNA-damaging agents.  Defects in overall DSB repair capacity can lead to genomic instability and carcinogenesis.  The tumor suppressor breast cancer susceptibility protein 1 (BRCA1) protects our cells from genomic instability in part by facilitating the efficient repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs).  BRCA1 promotes the error-free repair of DSBs through homologous recombination and is also implicated in the regulation of nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair fidelity.  The increased frequency of DSB mutagenesis and MMEJ repair in the absence of BRCA1 suggests a potential mechanism for carcinogenesis.  Comet assay under neutral conditions allows detection of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which has consequence to genome instability and carcinogenesis.  Loss of p15/Ink4b accompanies tumorigenesis triggered by complex DNA double-strand breaks.  Although DSBs are potentially carcinogenic, it is not clear whether complex DSBs that are refractory to repair are more potently tumorigenic compared with simple breaks that can be rapidly repaired, correctly or incorrectly, by mammalian cells.  Zinc chromate induces chromosome instability and DNA double strand breaks in human lung cells.

Nitric oxide and acid induce double-strand DNA breaks in Barrett's esophagus carcinogenesis via distinct mechanisms.  DNA double-strand break repair capacity and risk of breast cancer.  A tumorigenic role of the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) has been suggested by our finding of a significant association between increased breast cancer risk and a cooperative effect of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in NHEJ genes.  Carcinogen-induced DNA double strand break repair in sporadic breast cancer.  Induction of DNA double strand breaks and alterations in the repair of these breaks is implicated in breast carcinogenesis.  Prior studies have demonstrated that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from breast cancer patients exhibit increased numbers of DNA strand breaks after exposure to ionizing radiation, but these studies did not specifically measure DNA double strand breaks and it is not known whether chemical carcinogens produce similar effects.  Abnormal DNA end-joining activity in human head and neck cancer.  In human cells, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired primarily by the DNA end-joining (EJ) process and thus, abnormal DNA EJ activities lead to an accumulation of mutations and/or aneuploidy, resulting in genetic instability of cells.  Since genetic instability is the hallmark of cancer cells, we studied the DNA EJ activities of normal, non-malignant immortalized and malignant human epithelial cells to investigate the association between DNA EJ and carcinogenesis.  Homologous recombination repair plays an important role in DSB repair and impairment of this repair mechanism may lead to loss of genomic integrity, which is one of the hallmarks of cancer.  Recent research has shown that the tumor suppressor genes p53 and BRCA1 and -2 are involved in the proper control of homologous recombination, suggesting a role of this type of repair in human cancer.  In order to study the role of DNA damage processing in the development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), we assessed the ability of six keratinocyte cell lines from a multistage-tumor progression model to repair three types of DNA damage: pyrimidine dimers, oxidative DNA lesions and DNA double strand breaks (DSB).  However, an acquired deficiency in repairing DNA double strand breaks can be one mechanism promoting progression towards malignancy, possibly through impairing chromosomal stability.  Recent findings demonstrate that accelerated carcinogenesis following liver regeneration is associated with chronic inflammation-induced double-strand DNA breaks in cells, which escaped apoptosis due to proliferative stress.  Although DNA double-strand breaks and apoptosis may relate to arsenite-induced damage and carcinogenesis, the mechanism of action remains obscure. 
###question: Do DNA double-strand breaks play a causal role in carcinogenesis?[EOC] [SOR]###response: Yes.  It has been demonstrated that induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and defects in overall DSBs repair capacity can lead to an accumulation of mutations, resulting in genomic instability of cells.  Given that genomic instability is the hallmark of cancer, DSBs play a causal role in carcinogenesis. [EOR]"
"[SOC]###context: CONCLUSION: Endometriomas per se appear to be the main cause of the reduced long-term reproductive performance of the affected patients, with little or no contribution from surgery.  Furthermore, endometrioma surgery seems to improve the success rates of fertility treatment.  Amongst the 38 women desiring pregnancy after endometrioma surgery, 19 (50%) achieved a spontaneous pregnancy during the follow-up period.   Of 33 women who wished to conceive, 67% became pregnant, spontaneously in 59% CONCLUSIONS: Recurrence and pregnancy rates are encouraging in that they seem comparable to the best reported results after endometrioma cystectomy.   While laparoscopic excision is known to improve fertility, recurrence can cause significant ovarian damage and adverse affects on fertility.  Surgery is considered to play a role within the framework of the therapeutic options to cure infertile women with the disease even though its effectiveness is generally modest.   Randomized controlled trials showed that the excision technique is associated with a higher pregnancy rate and a lower rate of recurrence although it may determine severe injury to the ovarian reserve.   Surgical treatment is associated with a high recurrence rate and its employment for women undergoing assisted conception has recently been challenged.  Laparoscopic excision of ovarian endometrioma prior to IVF does not offer any additional benefit over expectant management.   For those women subsequently attempting to conceive it was also associated with a subsequent increased spontaneous pregnancy rate in women who had documented prior sub-fertility (OR 5. 21 CI 2. 04-13. 29).  here is insufficient evidence to favour excisional surgery over ablative surgery with respect to the chance of pregnancy after controlled ovarian stimulation and intra-uterine insemination (OR 1. 40 CI 0. 47-4. 15) .   CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that in a context of more than one year infertility only related to endometriosis, it is reasonable to offer these patients a complete operative laparoscopic treatment of their lesions, which enables 65% of them to be pregnant within a 8. 5 months post-surgical median time to pregnancy and spontaneously in 60%.    It was also associated with a subsequent increased rate of spontaneous pregnancy women who had documented prior sub-fertility (OR 5. 21 CI 2. 04-13. 29).  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is some evidence that excisional surgery for endometriomata provides for a more favourable outcome than drainage and ablation, with regard to the recurrence of the endometrioma, recurrence of symptoms and subsequent spontaneous pregnancy in women who were previously subfertile.   Surgery is an option for treatment, but there is no convincing evidence that it promotes a significant improvement in fertility.  In conclusion, ovarian surgery for the treatment of endometriosis reduces the ovarian outcome in IVF/ICSI cycles in women >35 years old, and might also decrease pregnancy rates.   Improvement of pain symptoms occurred in 87% of the patients and fertility rate was 45%.  The long-term results, especially the fertility outcome, have been promising: 12 of 20 women (60%) achieved a term pregnancy following a laparoscopic endometrioma procedure alone.   Among this group, 115 patients (54%) conceived following surgery; of these conceptions, 109 resulted in a living child.  WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Despite the available evidence that surgery for endometriomas does not improve the outcome of ART and may damage ovarian reserve, it seems that the majority of gynaecologists in the UK offer ovarian cystectomy to their patients.  Ovarian endometriomas does not exclude fertility.  Removal of endometriomas before in vitro fertilization does not improve fertility outcomes: a matched, case-control study.  Conclusion(s): Laparoscopic cystectomy for endometriomas before commencing an IVF cycle does not improve fertility outcomes.  Despite the available evidence that surgery for endometriomas does not improve the outcome of ART and may damage ovarian reserve, it seems that the majority of gynaecologists in the UK offer ovarian cystectomy to their patients.  Furthermore, laparoscopic removal of endometriomas does not improve IVF results, but may cause a decrease of ovarian responsiveness to gonadotropins.

METHODS: Multiple myeloma patients treated with thalidomide at Hitachi General Hospital.  Thalidomide showed some success in treating multiple myeloma either after auto-PBSCT or following treatment with bortezomib.  In the case demonstrating hematotoxicity Grade 3 (in addition to neutropenia), grave complications could have very easily developed, thus underscoring the importance of careful monitoring.  Patients aged ≥18 years with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma received intravenous bortezomib 1. 3 mg/m2, administered on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 of a 21-day cycle, for 3 cycles.  In patients with multiple myeloma or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, co-administration of rifampicin decreased the exposure to bortezomib but did not affect the proteasome inhibition or safety profiles; co-administration of dexamethasone did not affect the exposure to bortezomib, proteasome inhibition or safety profiles.  we provide data comparing sFLC with M protein as biomarkers of response in newly diagnosed patients with MM undergoing induction therapy with the novel agents thalidomide, lenalidomide and/or bortezomib.  Bortezomib, indicated for multiple myeloma (MM) treatment, is available in 3. 5-mg vials, a quantity higher than the average dose commonly prescribed.  Bortezomib, a dipeptidyl boronic acid and potent inhibitor of the 26S proteasome, is remarkably effective against multiple myeloma (MM) but not against solid tumors.  efficacy and safety of bortezomib (BOR) for treatment of multiple myeloma in comparison with thalidomide (THAL) by reference to adverse events, and searched for laboratory markers that could be used for prognostication of patients.  BOR showed a higher rate of effectiveness than THAL for refractory multiple myeloma, and its effects were rapid.  BOR treatment prolonged the survival time of THAL-resistant patients.  The efficacy of BOR was unrelated to patient age, the number of previous therapeutic regimens, or the disease period.  It is suggested that BOR has therapeutic efficacy for multiple myeloma as a first-line medical treatment and/or for patients with THAL resistance, and can improve prognosis and survival.  Since serum ALP elevation was observed in many patients for whom BOR was effective, this may be a predictor of BOR efficacy.  Bortezomib-treated MM patients whose tumours had high baseline expression of genes suppressed by LCQ195 had significantly shorter progression-free and overall survival than those with low levels of these transcripts in their MM cells.  These observations provide insight into the biological relevance of multi-targeted CDK inhibition in MM.  bortezomib is the only effective agent in the treatment of plasma cell leukemia (PCL), a type of plasma cell dyscrasia characterized by poor prognosis despite conventional chemotherapy including autologous and allogeneic transplantation.  These 3 patients with primary or secondary PCL who received a bortezomib-based regimen as rescue medication did not respond to treatment.  To evaluate the effects and safety of the regimen of bortezomib combined with dexamethasone (VD) in the treatment of primary systemic (AL) amyloidosis.  VD regimen might be an efficient, rapid effective and safe regimen in the treatment of AL amyloidosis.  Bortezomib (BZM) is a proteasome inhibitor in clinical use for multiple myeloma.  Here, we investigated whether the combination of these compounds would yield increased antitumor efficacy in multiple myeloma and glioblastoma cell lines in vitro and in vivo.  Taken together, our results indicate that green tea polyphenols may have the potential to negate the therapeutic efficacy of BZM and suggest that consumption of green tea products may be contraindicated during cancer therapy with BZM.  Relapsed/refractory myeloma has a poor outcome because of multi-drug resistance, patient low-performance status and toxicity of conventional chemotherapy.  Bortezomib, by inhibiting proteasome function, may enhance chemosensitivity to other drugs and overcome drug-resistance.  Notably, doxorubicin and bortezomib may reciprocally increase their efficacy.  Thus, to improve outcome whilst minimizing therapy-related toxicity, liposomal doxorubicin was added to a bortezomib-based combination.  the growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in combination with anti-EGFR drugs, such as gefitinib, vandetanib, and cetuximab in EGFR-expressing human cancer cell lines.  Bortezomib determined dose-dependent growth inhibition in a nine cancer cell line panel (IC(50) values, range 6-42 nM).  overexpression of a constitutively active P-Akt protected A549 cells by cell growth inhibition and apoptosis following treatment with bortezomib and EGFR inhibitors.  The combined treatment with bortezomib and EGFR inhibitors has a synergistic growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic activity in different human cancer cells which possess a functional EGFR-dependent autocrine growth pathway through to a more efficient and sustained inhibition of Akt.  Among 19 patients with breast cancer, four had evidence of a clinical benefit.  Pre-clinical studies combining the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib with anthracyclines have shown enhanced anti-tumor activity.  We conducted a phase I trial of bortezomib and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in patients with refractory solid tumors.  A regimen of bortezomib, 1. 3 mg/m(2) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 with PLD, 30 mg/m(2), on day 4 of a 21-day cycle, was safe in this study, and merits further investigation.  Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, has been used for patients with refractory and relapsed multiple myeloma, lymphoma and leukemia.  Bortezomib, a first-in-class proteasome inhibitor, has shown clinical activity in relapsed, refractory multiple myeloma in a pivotal Phase II trial, SUMMIT.  treatment with bortezomib results in meaningful long-term benefit for patients with relapsed and refractory myeloma.  The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BTZ), used in antineoplastic chemotherapy, must be diluted in NaCl 0. 9% for injection and stored for no more than 3 hours in a syringe or 8 hours in a vial.  Proteasome inhibitors, a novel class of chemotherapeutic agents, enhance the antitumor efficacy of anthracyclines in vitro and in vivo.  We therefore sought to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities of bortezomib and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PegLD).  Bortezomib was given on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 from 0. 90 to 1. 50 mg/m2 and PegLD on day 4 at 30 mg/m2 to 42 patients with advanced hematologic malignancies.  Antitumor activity was seen against multiple myeloma, with 8 of 22 evaluable patients having a complete response (CR) or near-CR, including several with anthracycline-refractory disease, and another 8 having partial responses (PRs).  One patient with relapsed/refractory T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) achieved a CR, whereas 2 patients each with acute myeloid leukemia and B-cell NHL had PRs.  Bortezomib/PegLD was safely administered in this study with promising antitumor activity, supporting further testing of this regimen.  These patients were treated with bortezomib variously combined with other drugs outside of clinical trials.

"[SOC]###context:  Cranberry products affect the surface properties, such as fimbriae and lipopolysaccharides, and adhesion of fimbriated and nonfimbriated E.  coli.    Cranberry juice has been shown to be effective in preventing adhesion of bacteria such as Escherichia coli to the bladder epithelium.  Inhibition of adherence to an extent of about 70% with multi-drug resistant E.  coli strains was observed on uroepithelial cell.  The anti-adherence bioactivity of the proanthocyanidin was detected at concentrations of 10-50 µg/ml with significant bacteriuria.   Still with regard to antibiotic treatment in women, a recently published study investigated also the potential cranberry juice interaction with beta-lactam antibiotics supporting the hypothesis that cranberry juice in usual quantities as prophylaxis for UTI is not likely to alter the pharmacokinetics of these oral antibiotics.  In vitro studies have shown that binding of the P fimbriae of Escherichia coli to the uroepithelial tissue can be inhibited in the presence of proanthocyanidins, the active ingredient of cranberries.  NDM at concentrations between 0. 2/mL and 1mg/mL significantly (P<. 05) decreased secretion of extracellular FTF, as well as down-regulated ftf expression in a dose-dependent manner.  NDM also markedly reduced the luciferase activity under the ftf promoter.  Cranberry juice has long been recognized in folk medicine as a therapeutic agent, mainly in urinary tract infections.  Its proposed mechanism of action is antiadhesion of bacteria.   The AFM adhesion force measurements were consistent with the results of a hemagglutination assay, confirming that oral consumption of CJC could act against adhesion of uropathogenic E.  coli.  These data suggest that daily consumption of concentrated cranberry juice can significantly prevent the recurrence of symptomatic UTIs in children.

"[SOC]###context: Our results suggest that Elg1, Ctf4, and Ctf18 may coordinate the relative movement of the replication fork with respect to the cohesin ring These data defined two cohesion pathways, one containing CSM3, TOF1, CTF4, and CHL1, and the second containing MRC1, CTF18, CTF8, and DCC1 Here we show that three proteins required for sister chromatid cohesion, Eco1, Ctf4, and Ctf18, are found at, and Ctf4 travels along chromosomes with, replication forks.  The ring-shaped cohesin complex is loaded onto chromosomes before S phase in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent reaction.  Cohesion establishment during DNA replication follows without further cohesin recruitment and without need for cohesin to re-engage an ATP hydrolysis motif that is critical for its initial DNA binding.  This provides evidence for cohesion establishment in the context of replication forks and imposes constraints on the mechanism involved Sister-chromatid cohesion mediated by the alternative RF-CCtf18/Dcc1/Ctf8, the helicase Chl1 and the polymerase-alpha-associated protein Ctf4 is essential for chromatid disjunction during meiosis II In budding yeast, a specialized replication factor C called RF-C(Ctf18/Dcc1/Ctf8) and the DNA-polymerase-alpha-associated protein Ctf4 are required to maintain sister-chromatid cohesion in cells arrested for long periods in mitosis We also show that, in contrast to mitosis, RF-C(Ctf18/Dcc1/Cft8), Ctf4 and Chl1 are essential for chromosome segregation during meiosis and for the viability of meiotic products.  Ctf8p is a component of Ctf18-RFC, an alternative replication factor C-like complex required for efficient sister chromatid cohesion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  We performed synthetic genetic array (SGA) analysis with a ctf8 deletion strain as a primary screen to identify other nonessential genes required for efficient sister chromatid cohesion.  We then assessed proficiency of cohesion at three chromosomal loci in strains containing deletions of the genes identified in the ctf8 SGA screen.  Deletion of seven genes (CHL1, CSM3, BIM1, KAR3, TOF1, CTF4, and VIK1) resulted in defective sister chromatid cohesion Saccharomyces cerevisiae CTF18 and CTF4 are required for sister chromatid cohesion CTF4 and CTF18 are required for high-fidelity chromosome segregation.  Both exhibit genetic and physical ties to replication fork constituents.  We find that absence of either CTF4 or CTF18 causes sister chromatid cohesion failure and leads to a preanaphase accumulation of cells that depends on the spindle assembly checkpoint.  The physical and genetic interactions between CTF4, CTF18, and core components of replication fork complexes observed in this study and others suggest that both gene products act in association with the replication fork to facilitate sister chromatid cohesion.

"[SOC]###context: The activity of SERCA is regulated by two small, homologous membrane proteins called phospholamban (PLB, also known as PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN).  Detailed structural information explaining this regulatory mechanism has been lacking, and the structural features defining the pathway through which cytoplasmic Ca(2+) enters the intramembranous binding sites of SERCA have remained unknown.  Sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)ATPase (SERCA) pump activity is modulated by phospholamban (PLB) and sarcolipin (SLN) in cardiac and skeletal muscle.  Recent data suggest that SLN could play a role in muscle thermogenesis by promoting uncoupling of the SERCA pump Here we show that sarcolipin (Sln), a newly identified regulator of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (Serca) pump, is necessary for muscle-based thermogenesis.  Sarcolipin (SLN) is a 3 kD membrane protein found in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR).  It has 31 amino acid residues; SLN and phopholamban (PLB) are belong to the same protein family, so they have similar physiological functions.  SLN inhibits sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) activity and reduces its affinity of Ca(2+), resulting in dysfunction of myocardial contraction and heart failure.  Sarcolipin (SLN) is a key regulator of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), and its expression is altered in diseased atrial myocardium.  Together, these findings indicate that ablation of SLN results in increased SERCA activity and SR Ca(2+) load, which, in turn, could cause abnormal intracellular Ca(2+) handling and atrial remodeling.  Sarcolipin (SLN) inhibits sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) pumps.  These results show that 1) SLN regulates Ca(2+)-ATPase activity thereby regulating contractile kinetics in at least some skeletal muscles, 2) the functional significance of SLN is graded to the endogenous SLN expression level, and 3) SLN inhibitory effects on SERCA function are relieved in response to repeated contractions thus enhancing relaxation rates.  The SERCA pump was constitutively activated in both atrial and ventricular chambers of the mouse heart by ablating its key regulators, phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN).  The double-knockout (dKO) mice for PLN and SLN showed increased SERCA pump activity, Ca(2+) transients and SR Ca(2+) load, and developed cardiac hypertrophy.  Our findings also emphasize the need for dynamic regulation of the SERCA pump by PLN and/or SLN to maintain cardiac contractility in normal conditions and during pathophysiological states.  Sarcolipin (SLN) has emerged as an important regulator of the atrial sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ transport.  The inhibitory effect of SLN on cardiac SR Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump can be relieved by beta-adrenergic stimulation, which indicates that SLN is a reversible inhibitor.   Sarcolipin is a novel regulator of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) and is expressed abundantly in atria.  Our study documented that sarcolipin is a key regulator of SERCA2a in atria.  Importantly, our data demonstrate the existence of distinct modulators for the SERCA pump in the atria and ventricles.  Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) is a membrane protein that catalyzes the ATP-dependent transport of Ca(2+) from the cytosol to the SR.  The activity of SERCA is inhibited by phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN), and all these proteins participate in maintaining the normal intracellular calcium handling.   Sarcolipin (SLN) is an integral membrane protein that is expressed in both skeletal and cardiac muscle, where it inhibits SERCA (calcium ATPase) by lowering its apparent Ca2+ affinity in a manner similar to that of its homologue phospholamban (PLN).  Remarkably, each domain of SLN behaves in a manner similar to that of the corresponding domains in PLN, supporting the hypothesis that both SLN and PLN bind SERCA in the same groove and with similar mechanisms.  The role of sarcolipin (SLN) in cardiac physiology was critically evaluated by generating a transgenic (TG) mouse model in which the SLN to sarco(endoplasmic)reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) ratio was increased in the ventricle.  Overexpression of SLN decreases SR calcium transport function and results in decreased calcium transient amplitude and rate of relaxation.  SLN TG hearts exhibit a significant decrease in rates of contraction and relaxation when assessed by ex vivo work-performing heart preparations.  We conclude that SLN is a novel regulator of SERCA pump activity, and its inhibitory effect can be reversed by beta-adrenergic agonists.  Sarcolipin, a homologue of phospholamban, regulates Ca2+ uptake through the interaction with sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) and is predominantly expressed in the atrial muscle.  Sarcolipin (SLN) and phospholamban (PLN) are effective inhibitors of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA).   These results show that NF-SLN expression impairs muscle contractile function by inhibiting SERCA function and diminishing sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) stores.  Sarcolipin (SLN) is an inhibitor of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPases (SERCAs) in vitro, but its function in vivo has not been defined.  NF-SLN cDNA (SLN tagged N-terminally with a FLAG epitope) was introduced into rat soleus muscle in one hindlimb by plasmid injection and electrotransfer.  Sarcolipin (SLN), a regulator of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase of fast-twitch skeletal muscle (SERCA1a), is also expressed in cardiac and slow-twitch skeletal muscles where phospholamban (PLN) and SERCA2a are expressed.  Sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) inhibition by sarcolipin is encoded in its luminal tail.  The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) is regulated in a tissue-dependent manner via interaction with the short integral membrane proteins phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN).  Phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN) are two single-pass membrane proteins that regulate Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), an ATP-driven pump that translocates calcium ions into the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, initiating muscle relaxation.  The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) is regulated in a tissue-dependent manner via interaction with the short integral membrane proteins phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN) [Research progress of sarcolipin-a new regulatory protein of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase].

###question: Is Sarcolipin a regulatory/inhibitory protein of the Calcium ATPase SERCA?[EOC] [SOR]###response: Sarcolipin (SLN) is a 3 kD membrane protein found in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and it is a newly identified regulator of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (Serca) pump.   SLN inhibits sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) activity and reduces its affinity of Ca(2+), resulting in dysfunction of myocardial contraction and heart failure.

AIMS: To prospectively validate the SYNTAX Score II and forecast the outcomes of the randomized Evaluation of the Xience Everolimus-Eluting Stent Versus Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for Effectiveness of Left Main Revascularization (EXCEL) Trial.  Based on 4-year mortality predictions in EXCEL, clinical characteristics shifted long-term mortality predictions either in favour of PCI (older age, male gender and COPD) or CABG (younger age, lower creatinine clearance, female gender, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction).  Given that the completed randomized trials did not include contemporary DESs, the upcoming results of the ongoing trials evaluating the performance of new-generation DES compared with CABG (such as the EXCEL trial), may further help to clarify the current role and future recommendations of PCI for left main coronary artery disease.   The ongoing EXCEL trial will help elucidate the role of ULMCA PCI in the treatment of left main disease compared with coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

"[SOC]###context: Here we show that HP1 can bind with high affinity to histone H3 methylated at lysine 9 but not at lysine 4 Methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 creates a binding site for HP1 proteins.   Here we show that mammalian methyltransferases that selectively methylate histone H3 on lysine 9 (Suv39h HMTases) generate a binding site for HP1 proteins--a family of heterochromatic adaptor molecules implicated in both gene silencing and supra-nucleosomal chromatin structure.  We show that methylated lysine 9 of histone H3 (Me9H3) is a marker of heterochromatin in divergent animal species.   Finally, we provide evidence that Me9H3 is neither necessary nor sufficient for localisation of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) to chromosomal DNA.  Structure of HP1 chromodomain bound to a lysine 9-methylated histone H3 tai Here, we present structural, energetic, and mutational analyses of the complex between the Drosophila HP1 chromodomain and the histone H3 tail with a methyllysine at residue 9, a modification associated with epigenetic silencing Methylation of lysine 9 in histone H3 is recognized by heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), which directs the binding of other proteins to control chromatin structure and gene expression.   In Drosophila S2 cells, and on polytene chromosomes, methyl-Lys 27 and Pc are both excluded from areas that are enriched in methyl-Lys 9 and HP1 To better understand the molecular basis for the selection of methyl-lysine binding sites, we solved the 1. 8 A structure of the Pc chromodomain in complex with a H3 peptide bearing trimethyl-Lys 27, and compared it with our previously determined structure of the HP1 chromodomain in complex with a H3 peptide bearing trimethyl-Lys 9.  Tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 is important for recruiting heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) to discrete regions of the genome, thereby regulating gene expression, chromatin packaging and heterochromatin formation.   We investigated the role of Suz12 in constitutive heterochromatin and discovered that Suz12 is required for histone H3 lysine 9 tri-methylation (H3K9me3) in differentiated but not undifferentiated mouse embryonic stem cells.  Pericentric H3K9me3 Formation by HP1 Interaction-defective Histone Methyltransferase Suv39h1 Pericentric regions form epigenetically organized, silent heterochromatin structures that accumulate histone H3 lysine 9 tri-methylation (H3K9me3) and heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), a methylated H3K9-binding protein.   LSD1 cooperates with ASXL1 in transcriptional repression, presumably by removing H3K4 methylation, an active histone mark, but not H3K9 methylation, a repressive histone mark recognized by HP1.  We investigated the chromatin marks to which TFL2/LHP1 binds and show that, in vitro, TFL2/LHP1 binds to histone H3 di- or tri-methylated at lysine 9 (H3K9me2 or H3K9me3), the marks recognized by HP1, and to histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), the mark deposited by PRC2.  Cbx3 is one of the paralogues of HP1 proteins, which has been reported to specifically recognize trimethylated histone H3K9 mark, and a consensus binding motif has been defined for the Cbx3 chromodomain.  For instance, tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3) is important for recruiting heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) to discrete regions of the genome, thereby regulating gene expression, chromatin packaging, and heterochromatin formation.  Here we discuss functions of the Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) family of proteins that recognize H3K9me, an epigenetic mark generated by the histone methyltransferases SU(VAR)3-9 and orthologues.  Binding of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) to the histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) mark is a hallmark of establishment and maintenance of heterochromatin.  Al so on.  Cbx3 is one of the paralogues of HP1 proteins, which has been reported to specifically recognize trimethylated histone H3K9 mark, and a consensus binding motif has been defined for the Cbx3 chromod Until now, little was known about the regulation of effector-histone mark interactions, and in particular, of the binding of HP1 to H3K9me3.  Recently, we and others presented evidence that a ""binary methylation-phosphorylation switch"" mechanism controls the dynamic release of HP1 from H3K9me3 during the cell cycle: phosphorylation of histone H3 serine 10 (H3S10ph) occurs at the onset of mitosis, interferes with HP1-H3K9me3 interaction, and therefore, ejects HP1 from its binding site.  Our simulated results further confirm the essential role of cation-pi interactions for the binding of a methylated H3 tail by an HP1 chromodomain but indicate that the effect from an electrostatic origin is not dominant in distinguishing between the H3K9Me3 mark and its unmethylated counterpart.  Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) proteins, recognized readers of the heterochromatin mark methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me), are important regulators of heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing and chromosome structure.

"[SOC]###context: Human Wapl is a cohesin-binding protein that promotes sister-chromatid resolution in mitotic prophase We show that the human ortholog of Wapl is a cohesin-binding protein that facilitates cohesin's timely release from chromosome arms during prophase.  Conversely, overexpression of Wapl causes premature separation of sister chromatids.  Wapl physically associates with cohesin in HeLa-cell nuclear extracts.  Wapl controls the dynamic association of cohesin with chromatin Here, we show that the interaction between cohesin and chromatin is controlled by Wapl, a protein implicated in heterochromatin formation and tumorigenesis.  Wapl is associated with cohesin throughout the cell cycle, and its depletion blocks cohesin dissociation from chromosomes during the early stages of mitosis and prevents the resolution of sister chromatids until anaphase, which occurs after a delay.  Wapl depletion also increases the residence time of cohesin on chromatin in interphase.  Our data indicate that Wapl is required to unlock cohesin from a particular state in which it is stably bound to chromatin.  In recent articles published in Cell and Current Biology, the characterization of Wapl, a newly identified cohesin-interacting protein, suggests that a dynamic interaction between the cohesin complex and chromatin is important for normal regulation of sister chromatid cohesion.  Wapl protein regulates binding of the cohesin complex to chromosomes during interphase and helps remove cohesin from chromosomes at mitosis Wapl-AG was found to increase the stability of cohesin binding to polytene chromosomes.  Our data suggest that increasing cohesin stability interferes with PcG silencing at genes that are co-regulated by cohesin and PcG proteins.  .  First, during prophase and prometaphase, the bulk of cohesin is driven from chromosome arms by the cohesin antagonist WAPL.   s a consequence, WAPL-depleted cells undergo anaphase with segregation errors, including both lagging chromosomes and catenanes, resulting in micronuclei and DNA damage.  Stable WAPL depletion arrests cells in a p53-dependent manner but causes p53-deficient cells to become highly aneuploid.  Our data show that the WAPL-dependent prophase pathway is essential for proper chromosome segregation and is crucial to maintain genomic integrity.  cohesin suppresses compartments but is required for TADs and loops, that CTCF defines their boundaries, and that the cohesin unloading factor WAPL and its PDS5 binding partners control the length of loops ohesin has an essential genome-wide function in mediating long-range chromatin interactions and support the hypothesis that cohesin creates these by loop extrusion, until it is delayed by CTCF in a manner dependent on PDS5 proteins, or until it is released from DNA by WAPL.  The Cohesin Release Factor WAPL Restricts Chromatin Loop Extension.  Cohesin's DNA release factor WAPL restricts this loop extension and also prevents looping between incorrectly oriented CTCF sites We conclude that the balanced activity of SCC2/SCC4 and WAPL enables cohesin to correctly structure chromosomes.  Cohesin is positioned in mammalian genomes by transcription, CTCF and Wapl.  the distribution of cohesin in the mouse genome depends on transcription, CTCF and the cohesin release factor Wings apart-like (Wapl).   In the absence of both CTCF and Wapl, cohesin accumulates in up to 70 kilobase-long regions at 3'-ends of active genes, in particular if these converge on each other.  the cohesin regulator Wapl promotes the release of cohesin from chromosomes during both interphase and mitosis.   Brca2, Pds5 and Wapl differentially control cohesin chromosome association and function.  Pds5 and Wapl, but not Brca2, limit the distance that cohesin extends from origins, thereby determining which active genes, enhancers and silencers bind cohesin.  Using RNA-seq we find that Brca2, Pds5 and Wapl influence the expression of most genes sensitive to Nipped-B and cohesin, largely in the same direction.

Interestingly, silencing of uc. 63 induces apoptosis in vitro.  However, silencing of host gene XPO1 does not cause the same effect suggesting that the transcription of uc. 63 is independent of XPO1.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcripts longer than 200 bp with no protein-coding capacity.  Transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) are a type of lncRNA and are conserved among human, chick, dog, mouse and rat genomes.  These sequences are involved in cancer biology and tumourigenesis.  Nevertheless, the clinical significance and biological mechanism of T-UCRs in breast cancer remain largely unknown.  The expression of uc. 38, a T-UCR, was down-regulated in both breast cancer tissues and breast cancer cell lines.  However, uc. 38 was expressed at significantly lower levels in larger tumours and tumours of more advanced stages.  Based on the results of in vitro and in vivo experiments, up-regulation of uc. 38 expression inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis.  Thus, uc. 38 suppressed breast cancer.

"[SOC]###context: In this study, we demonstrate that autophagy is a critical mediator of the viral degradation pathway and that this pathway is not HIV-1 specific.  Autophagy is important in cellular homeostasis for the cell survival mechanism.  Autophagy is a cellular survival pathway that is necessary for the degradation of cellular constituents such as long-lived proteins and damaged organelles.  Autophagy-related genes (ATGs) regulate the autophagy and also control the crosstalk with autophagy-associated cell death and apoptosis in some condition.   Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved cellular process in which intracellular components are eliminated via lysosomal degradation to supply nutrients for organelle biogenesis and metabolic homeostasis.  Autophagy is a lysosome-associated, degradative process that catabolizes cytosolic components to recycle nutrients for further use and maintain cell homeostasis.  Autophagy is a self-eating process, in which the damaged or excessed cell organelles and misfolded protein aggregates are removed from the cellular microenvironment.  Autophagy is a lysosome-associated, degradative process that catabolizes cytosolic components to recycle nutrients for further use and maintain cell homeostasis.  Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved cellular process in which intracellular components are eliminated via lysosomal degradation to supply nutrients for organelle biogenesis and metabolic homeostasis.  Autophagy is a homeostatic process involved in the turnover or elimination of cytoplasmic components, damaged organelles, and protein aggregates via a lysosomal degradation mechanism.  Autophagy is known as a catabolic process for the recycling of the cytoplasmic macromolecules.

"[SOC]###context: Interleukin 18--binding protein ameliorates liver ischemia--reperfusion injury.   IL-18BP exhibited anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and protective effects in I/R-mediated hepatic injury via regulating some liver enzyme activities and cytokine levels.   Because of IL-18's potential pro-inflammatory and tissue destructive effects, its biological activities are tightly controlled in the body by its naturally occurring antagonist called IL-18BP.  The antagonist is produced in the body both constitutively and in response to an increased production of IL-18 as a negative feedback mechanism.  Under physiological conditions, most of IL-18 in the circulation is bound with IL-18BP and is inactive.  However, an imbalance in the production of IL-18 and its antagonist (an increase in the production of IL-18 with a decrease, no increase or an insufficient increase in the production of IL-18BP) has been described in many chronic inflammatory diseases in humans.  L-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) is a natural inhibitor of IL-18.   Platelets also contain the IL-18 antagonist, the IL-18-Binding Protein (IL-18BP) The natural inhibitor IL-18BP , whose production is enhanced by IFN-γ and IL-27, further regulates IL-18 activity in the extracellular environment.   IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) is a naturally occurring inhibitor of IL-18.   IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) is a natural inhibitor of IL-18.  The balance between IL-18 and IL-18BP has an important role in the inflammatory setting.

"[SOC]###context: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of the four medications with a US FDA-approved indication for PMDD: fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine and drospirenone plus ethinyl estradiol (DRSP/EE).  All SSRIs (fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, citalopram, and clomipramine) were effective in reducing premenstrual symptoms.  Paroxetine has been approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder (PD), generalised anxiety disorder, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and social anxiety disorder (SAD) in adults, whereas paroxetine CR is approved for the treatment of MDD, SAD, PD and premenstrual dysphoric disorder in adults.  Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been proven safe and effective for the treatment of PMDD and are recommended as first-line agents when pharmacotherapy is warranted.  Currently fluoxetine, controlled-release paroxetine, and sertraline are the only Food and Drug Administration-approved agents for this indication.  When compared with placebo, patients treated with paroxetine 20 mg attained a significant reduction in irritability (difference in median percent change: -23. 9, 95% CI = -51. 3 to -6. 2, p = . 014; difference in mean absolute change: -18. 6, 95% CI = -32. 5 to -4. 6, p = . 007).  A statistically significant difference was not observed when the patients treated with the lower dose of paroxetine (10 mg) were compared with placebo.  Treatment was well tolerated with no unexpected side effects.  Intermittent administration of paroxetine 20 mg significantly reduced irritability symptoms in patients with PMDD.  All these women had significant improvements in the HAMA, HAMD, CGI, and PRISM calendar.  The rate of response to paroxetine treatment lay between 50% and 78. 6% in the continuous-treatment group, and 37. 5-93. 8% in the intermittent-treatment group, as determined at the study end-point.  The present results indicate that paroxetine is effective in both continuous and intermittent treatment of oriental PMDD women, and that the effects of active treatment lasted for six consecutive treatment menstrual cycles.  Paroxetine CR is approved for the treatment of major depression, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder and premenstrual dysphoric disorder in adults.  Continuous treatment with paroxetine reduced premenstrual symptoms effectively with a response rate of 85%.  Intermittent treatment was as effective as continuous treatment in reducing irritability, affect lability, and mood swings, but had a somewhat weaker effect on depressed mood and somatic symptoms.  Daily Record of Severity of Problems scores were lower in the paroxetine group compared with the placebo group, although the differences were not statistically significant.  However, the mean on-treatment Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (clinician-rated) score for the paroxetine group was 17. 9 +/- 8. 3 compared with 31. 5 +/- 11. 2 in the placebo group (adjusted mean difference = 13. 6, P = 0. 009).  Response (Clinical Global Impressions Scale score of 1 or 2) occurred in 70% of subjects randomized to paroxetine CR and 10% of those assigned to placebo (chi2(1) = 7. 5, P = 0. 006).  The US Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada recently approved paroxetine for the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder.  Patients treated with either dose of paroxetine CR demonstrated significantly greater improvements on the primary efficacy measure (change from baseline in mean luteal phase VAS-Mood scores) and on the majority of secondary efficacy measures compared with patients randomly assigned to placebo.  For the treatment of PMDD, luteal phase dosing with 12. 5 mg and 25 mg of paroxetine CR is effective and generally well tolerated.  A statistically significant difference was observed in favor of paroxetine CR 25 mg versus placebo on the VAS-Mood (adjusted mean difference = -12. 58 mm, 95% CI = -18. 40 to -6. 76; p < . 001) and for paroxetine CR 12. 5 mg versus placebo (adjusted mean difference = -7. 51 mm, 95% CI = -13. 40 to -1. 62; p = . 013).  Paroxetine CR doses of 12. 5 mg/day and 25 mg/day are effective in treating PMDD and are well tolerated.  At end point, subjects treated with paroxetine CR (12. 5 mg and 25 mg) demonstrated significant improvement in VAS-Mood scores compared with those who received placebo (paroxetine CR 12. 5 mg mean treatment difference vs.  placebo, -8. 7 mm; 95% CI, -15. 7, -1. 7; p =. 015; paroxetine CR 25 mg mean treatment difference vs.  placebo, -12. 1 mm; 95% CI, -18. 9, -5. 3; p <. 001).  Both doses of paroxetine CR 12. 5 mg and 25 mg daily are effective and well tolerated in patients who suffer from PMDD.  Of these agents, sertraline, fluoxetine and paroxetine (as an extended-release formulation) are approved by the US FDA for luteal phase, as well as continuous, administration.  In well designed placebo-controlled trials in patients with major depressive disorder (including a study in the elderly), social anxiety disorder or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), paroxetine CR was consistently superior to placebo with regards to primary endpoints (i. e.  mean Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression total score [major depressive disorder], Liebowitz social anxiety scale total score and Clinical Global Impressions-Global Improvement score [social anxiety disorder] and Visual Analogue Scale-Mood score [PMDD]).  Paroxetine is a potent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with indications for the treatment of depression, obsessive- compulsive disorder, panic disorder and social phobia.  It is also used in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder and chronic headache.  Studies having compared the efficiency of antidepressants according to their serotonin activity (paroxetine or sertraline versus maprotiline, that is a selective noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitor), showed that serotonin re-uptake inhibitors were significantly more efficient on all symptoms than maprotiline, that was not more efficient than placebo.  Paroxetine is a potent and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with currently approved indications for the treatment of depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder and social phobia.  It is also used in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder and chronic headache.  Preliminary data suggest that paroxetine has potential in the treatment of social phobia, premenstrual dysphoric disorder and chronic headache.  The effects of active treatment were marked by the first active cycle with luteal phase 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores decreasing from 14. 9 (+/- 5. 3) to 8. 2 (+/- 4. 9) in the first, 7. 8 (+/- 5. 1) in the second, and 7. 8 (+/- 6. 8) in the third active treatment cycles (F[1,13] = 17. 6; p < 0. 0001).  The most conservative measure, the Clinical Global Impression (CGI), revealed that 7 of 14 patients had a complete response (CGI = 1 or 2) whereas 4 patients had a partial response (CGI = 3).  These open trial findings are consistent with the notion that paroxetine is effective in the acute phase for the treatment of PDD.  The rating of premenstrual irritability, depressed mood, increase in appetite, and anxiety/tension was markedly lower during treatment with paroxetine than before, and this reduction in symptomatology appeared unabated for the entire treatment period.

"[SOC]###context: In this study, the levels of amino acids and trichloroacetic acid (TCA) cycle-related molecules in the colonic tissues and sera of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) were profiled by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), with the aim of evaluating whether the clinical state induced by UC leads to variations in the amino acid profile Our study raises the possibility that GC/MS-based profiling of amino acids and TCA cycle-related molecules is a useful early diagnostic tool for UC.  Succinate is an intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and plays a crucial role in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation in mitochondria.  In plasma, most metabolites in the central metabolic pathway (glycolysis and TCA cycle) were significantly downregulated after zymosan administration Thus, IL-1beta+TNFalpha treated astrocytes show a marked decrease in glycogen levels, a slight but not significant decrease in lactate release as well as a massive increase in both the pentose phosphate pathway and TCA cycle activities.  A total of 77 and 92 metabolites were detected in serum and colon tissue, respectively, and among the metabolites the compositions of TCA cycle intermediates and amino acids changed depending on the degree of colitis Extension of these findings identified a functional role for stretch-induced inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in mediating normoxic HIF1A stabilization, concomitant increases in glycolytic capacity, and improved tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle function These studies reveal a surprising role for HIF1A in lung protection during ALI, where normoxic HIF1A stabilization and HIF-dependent control of alveolar-epithelial glucose metabolism function as an endogenous feedback loop to dampen lung inflammation These results suggest a cataplerosis of the TCA cycle induced by phenobarbital, caused by the massive withdrawal of succinyl-CoA by ALAS induction, such that the TCA cycle is unable to supply the reduced cofactors to the RC The mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were explored in the Hmbs(-/-) mouse model.  RC and TCA cycle were significantly affected in comparison to controls in mice treated with phenobarbital with decreased activities of RC complexes Several changes in substrate utilization for energy homeostasis were identified in severe AAH, including increased glucose consumption by the pentose phosphate pathway, altered tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity, and enhanced peptide catabolism.   Enhanced mitochondrial glucose oxidation was achieved by increased recruitment of the NOTCH1 intracellular domain (NICD1) to nuclear and mitochondrial genes that encode respiratory chain components and by NOTCH-dependent induction of pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 1 (Pdp1) expression, pyruvate dehydrogenase activity, and glucose flux to the TCA cycle.   Metabolic reprogramming is implicated in macrophage activation, BHB blocks the NLRP3 inflammasome without undergoing oxidation in the TCA cycle, and independently of uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2), sirtuin-2 (SIRT2), the G protein-coupled receptor GPR109A or hydrocaboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2).   Our findings suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of caloric restriction or ketogenic diets may be linked to BHB-mediated inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome.

"[SOC]###context: As the syndrome occurred after the acute cholinergic syndrome but before organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy, the syndrome was called 'intermediate syndrome'.  The characteristic features of the IMS are weakness of the muscles of respiration (diaphragm, intercostal muscles and accessory muscles including neck muscles) and of proximal limb muscles.  Accompanying features often include weakness of muscles innervated by some cranial nerves.  It is now emerging that the degree and extent of muscle weakness may vary following the onset of the IMS.   Electrophysiological studies following OP poisoning have revealed three characteristic phenomena: (i) repetitive firing following a single stimulus; (ii) gradual reduction in twitch height or compound muscle action potential followed by an increase with repetitive stimulation (the 'decrement-increment response'); and (iii) continued reduction in twitch height or compound muscle action potential with repetitive simulation ('decrementing response').   Organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy is a sensory-motor distal axonopathy which usually occurs after exposure of certain OP insecticides.  Neuropathies due to ingestion of OPs have rarely been reported in the literature.  We report a patient with serious organophosphorus-induced delayed neuropathy due to malathion injection.  The patient was a 32-year-old female who self-injected undetermined amounts of malathion over the median nerve trace on the forearm crease in a suicide attempt which resulted in peripheral neuropathy.   Acutely, these patients present with cholinergic crisis; intermediate syndrome and delayed polyneuropathy are other sequel of this form of poisoning.  There was no strong evidence of irreversible peripheral nerve damage following acute OP poisoning, however further studies are required.  Particular interactions are also addressed, such as those of pesticides acting as endocrine disruptors, the cumulative toxicity of organophosphates and organochlorines resulting in estrogenic effects and the promotion of organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy.  The multivariate analyses showed that the population living in areas with high pesticide use had an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease and suicide attempts and that males living in these areas had increased risks for polyneuropathies, affective disorders and suicide attempts.   These compounds cause four important neurotoxic effects in humans: the cholinergic syndrome, the intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP) and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND).   An 18-year-old woman and a 22-year-old man were admitted to the hospital with weakness, paresthesia, and gait disturbances at 35 and 22 days, respectively, after ingesting dimethyl-2,2-dichloro vinyl phosphate (DDVP).  Neurological examination revealed weakness, vibration sense loss, bilateral dropped foot, brisk deep tendon reflexes, and bilaterally positive Babinski sign.  Electroneurography demonstrated distal motor polyneuropathy with segmental demyelination associated with axonal degeneration prominent in the distal parts of both lower extremities.  Sensory complaints and electrodiagnostic findings consistent with polyneuropathy were found in a minority (3/7) of subjects 28 years after an acute toxic arsenic exposure.  Organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP) is a rare toxicity resulting from exposure to certain organophosphorus (OP) esters.   Therefore, OPIDP may develop only after very large exposures to insecticides, causing severe cholinergic toxicity.  Several studies have reported the occurrence of sensory neuropathy with exposure to chlorpyrifos and other organophosphorus insecticides, at levels not associated with overt toxicity.   We found no evidence of sensory neuropathy or isolated peripheral abnormalities among subjects with long-term chlorpyrifos exposure at levels known to be associated with the manufacturing process.  Persistent, mainly motor, impairment of the peripheral nervous system was found in men two years after OP poisoning, in particular in severe occupational and intentional poisonings with neuropathic OPs.  This finding is possibly due to remaining organophosphate induced delayed polyneuropathy.  Besides the well known acute cholinergic toxicity, these compounds may cause late-onset distal polyneuropathy occurring two to three weeks after the acute exposure.   Electromyography demonstrated motor weighed sensory-motor polyneuropathy with axonal degeneration significant in the distal parts of bilateral lower extremities.   The two cases are presented here since organophosphate poisonings are common in our country, and since late-onset polyneuropathy is not a well known clinical presentation as acute toxicity.  The course of organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP) in humans has not been quantitatively measured in epidemiologic studies.  The persistence of deficits in motor strength in all severely poisoned patients regardless of pesticide type was unexpected, and may reflect persistent cholinergic blockade or intermediate syndrome, neuropathy, or a combination of these.  The findings showed a strong association between exposure to OP concentrate and neurological symptoms, but a less consistent association with sensory thresholds.   Following accidental or suicidal exposure, these anticholinesterases lead to three well defined neurological syndromes i. e.  initial life threatening acute cholinergic crisis which often requires management in intensive care unit, intermediate syndrome in which cranial nerve palsies, proximal muscle weakness and respiratory muscle weakness are common and patients often require respiratory support and delayed organophosphate induced polyneuropathy.  [Late onset polyneuropathy due to exposure to organophosphates].   Less often a polyneuropathic syndrome of late onset may occur.  On electromyography there was sensomotor peripheral polyneuropathy, which was primarily axonal and predominantly motor and distal.  Peripheral nerve biopsy confirmed the presence of 'dying back' type axonopathy.   Agricultural workers chronically exposed to organophosphate insecticides, without adequate protection, have an increased risk of developing late onset neuropathy due to organophosphates.   Epidemiologic studies on pesticides have found associations with long-term effects on health mainly in three fields: cancer (especially hematological cancer), neurotoxic effects (polyneuropathy, neuro-behavioral hazards, Parkinson's disease), and reproductive disorders (infertility, birth defects, adverse pregnancy outcomes, perinatal mortality).   EMG studies showed evidence of partial denervation of the anterior tibial group of muscles and flexor digiti minimi in 2 of the 30 workers (6. 7%) who underwent EMG examination.  Neurological symptoms consist in cerebro-organic disfunctions, locomotory disorders reminiscent of multiple sclerosis or M.  Parkinson, and sensory, motoric and vegetative polyneuropathy, leading, for instance, to cardiovascular regulatory disorder like sympathicotonia or, orthostatic hypotonia.   Thirty percent of patients had definite or possible exposure to organophosphate pesticides, and the peak use coincides with the peak incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome.  These results suggest that previously reported cases of organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy may represent only the worst disease in a spectrum of impairment, a sequela of exposure that may be much more common than previously thought.  It is suggested that the main cause of nervous lesions in these cases was the complex effect of pesticides.  Delayed polyneuropathy develops within 1 to 3 weeks and abates after 6 to 12 months.   Isolated case reports have circumstantially linked the use of the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) to polyneuropathy.  Thus, the weight of evidence indicates that 2,4-D is an unlikely cause of polyneuropathy.  A patient is reported presenting a cerebellar disorder developing about 5 weeks after acute exposure to an organophosphate insecticide.   Less well known, but more complex and idiosyncratic, is the potential for some agents to produce a delayed and progressive polyneuropathy--Organophosphorus Induced Delayed Neurotox-icity (OPIDN).   It is also quite probable that human neurotoxicity may be a potential hazard from exposure to more than the handful of organophosphorus pesticides that have been described in the literature.  In the present study the electroencephalograms of 3 of a group 10 workmen, who had been continually exposed to hexachlorcyclohexane, show pathological findings.  The electromyograms of 8 of these 10 workman demonstrate a disturbance of the peripherical motoneuron.  All probands, who exhibit o pathological EEG, also show a polyneuropathy.  Many organophosphorus compounds, including the organophosphate insecticides, may cause polyneuropathy of delayed onset.  Nevertheless, we describe a patient with delayed polyneuropathy after suicidal ingestion of parathion.  Following acute organophosphorus (OP) poisoning patients complain of numbness without objective sensory abnormalities or other features of OP induced delayed polyneuropathy.

"[SOC]###context: During T3-dependent amphibian metamorphosis, the digestive tract is extensively remodeled from the larval to the adult form for the adaptation of the amphibian from its aquatic herbivorous lifestyle to that of a terrestrial carnivorous frog.  This involves de novo formation of ASCs that requires T3 signaling in both the larval epithelium and nonepithelial tissues.  Our results revealed that T3 induces distinct tissue-specific gene regulation programs associated with the remodeling of the intestine, particularly the formation of the ASCs, and further suggested the existence of potentially many novel stem cell-associated genes, at least in the intestine during development.  BMP signaling is an important modulator of the late differentiation stages in MSC chondrogenesis and the thyroid hormone induces this pathway.   In addition, thyroid hormone treatment of hiPS-CMs attenuated the fetal gene expression in favor of a more adult-like pattern.   Exposure of embryos at this developmental stage for 24 h to either a TH antagonist, NH-3, or to tetrabromobisphenol A, a flame retardant and known TH disruptor, differentially modulated the expression of a number of TH target genes implicated in neural stem cell function or neural differentiation.   In the intestinal epithelium and the retina, TRα1 and TRβ2 are expressed at the level of the precursors where they induce cell proliferation and differentiation, respectively.   Thyroid hormone signaling acts as a neurogenic switch by repressing Sox2 in the adult neural stem cell niche.  We will discuss observations suggesting that liganded T3 receptor (TR) regulates cell autonomous formation of adult intestinal progenitor cells and that T3 action in the connective tissue is important for the establishment of the stem cell niche.  In general, in vitro stem cell differentiation techniques stimulate a wide range of developmental programs, including thyroid hormone receptor (TR) pathways.  Although no difference of in vitro proliferation of NSCs was observed in the presence of epidermal growth factor, maturation of oligodendrocytes (defined by process number and length) was enhanced in hyperthyroidism, suggesting a more mature state than in control animals.   Terminal erythroid maturation was significantly improved by adding human serum and thyroid hormone (3,5,3'-triiodothyronine [T3]) to the differentiation medium.  This resulted in highly synchronous differentiation of the cells toward enucleated erythrocytes within 6 days T(3) alone stimulated neural differentiation in a similar fashion as that seen with RA in both wtES and mES cells.   Thus, c-erbA/TR appears to act as a binary switch affecting erythroid cell fate: unliganded c-erbA/TR supports growth while ligand-activated c-erbA/TR induces differentiation.   The thyroid hormone receptor functions as a ligand-operated developmental switch between proliferation and differentiation of erythroid progenitors.  Thyroid hormones induce hemopoietic pluripotent stem cell differentiation toward erythropoiesis 
###question: What is the role of thyroid hormone in Stem cell differentiation?[EOC] [SOR]###response: Thyroid hormone treatment of Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes attenuates the fetal gene expression and induces differentiation.  Liganded T3 receptor (TR) regulates cell autonomous formation of adult intestinal progenitor cells and that T3 action in the connective tissue is important for the establishment of the stem cell niche.  In the intestinal epithelium, TRα1 and TRβ2 are expressed at the level of  stem/progenitor cell populations where they induce cell proliferation and differentiation, respectively.   Thyroid hormone is implicated in neural stem cell function and differentiation and acts as a neurogenic switch in the adult neural stem cell niche.  Furthermore, thyroid hormone enhances maturation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells.  Thyroid hormones also induce hemopoietic pluripotent stem cell differentiation toward erythropoiesis and  c-erbA/TR appears to act as a binary switch affecting erythroid cell fate: unliganded c-erbA/TR supports growth while ligand-activated c-erbA/TR induces differentiation.  Finally, thyroid hormone modulates late differentiation stages of mesenchymal stem cells chondrogenesis via BMP signaling. [EOR]"
"[SOC]###context: There are several genes on chromosome 4q35 region including DUX4 within D4Z4 repeats.  Transcription of these genes is usually repressed by epigenetic modifications of this chromosomal region and also accumulation of transcriptional repressors to the repeat array.  Recent studies provide compelling evidence that a retrotransposed gene in the D4Z4 repeat, DUX4, is expressed in the human germline and then epigenetically silenced in somatic tissues.   The human double-homeodomain retrogene DUX4 is expressed in the testis and epigenetically repressed in somatic tissues.  Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is a progressive muscular dystrophy caused by decreased epigenetic repression of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeats and ectopic expression of DUX4, a retrogene encoding a germline transcription factor encoded in each repeat.   These mice recapitulate important epigenetic and DUX4 expression attributes seen in patients and controls, respectively, including high DUX4 expression levels in the germline, (incomplete) epigenetic repression in somatic tissue, and FSHD-specific variegated DUX4 expression in sporadic muscle nuclei associated with D4Z4 chromatin relaxation.  DUX4, a retrogene contained in the D4Z4 repeats, is normally epigenetically silenced in somatic cells.  In contrast to control skeletal muscle and most other somatic tissues, full-length DUX4 transcript and protein is expressed at relatively abundant levels in human testis, most likely in the germ-line cells.  Induced pluripotent (iPS) cells also express full-length DUX4 and differentiation of control iPS cells to embryoid bodies suppresses expression of full-length DUX4, whereas expression of full-length DUX4 persists in differentiated FSHD iPS cells.  Together, these findings indicate that full-length DUX4 is normally expressed at specific developmental stages and is suppressed in most somatic tissues.  Recent studies provide compelling evidence that a retrotransposed gene in the D4Z4 repeat, DUX4, is expressed in the human germline and then epigenetically silenced in somatic tissues.  DUX4, a retrogene contained in the D4Z4 repeats, is normally epigenetically silenced in somatic cells.

In each D4Z4 element, we identified the double homeobox 4 (DUX4) gene.  DUX4 expresses a transcription factor that plays a major role in the development of FSHD through the initiation of a large gene dysregulation cascade that causes myogenic differentiation defects, atrophy and reduced response to oxidative stress.   decreased epigenetic repression and variegated expression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle (incomplete) epigenetic repression in somatic tissue, Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is characterized by chromatin relaxation of the D4Z4 macrosatellite array on chromosome 4 and expression of the D4Z4-encoded DUX4 gene in skeletal muscle.  derepression of the DUX4 retrogene The aim of our study was to identify relationships between epigenetic parameters correlating with a relaxed chromatin state of the DUX4 promoter region and clinical severity as measured by a clinical severity score or muscle pathologic changes in D4Z4 contraction-dependent (FSHD1) and -independent (FSHD2) facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy patients.   Specifically, abundance of RNA transcripts encoded by the DUX4 locus correlated to differential DNA methylation and H3K36me3 enrichment.  Together, these findings indicate that full-length DUX4 is normally expressed at specific developmental stages and is suppressed in most somatic tissue

"[SOC]###context: In vitro, we show that pharmacologic inhibition of Hsp90 by IPI-504 exerts antiproliferative effects in a panel of pancreatic cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner.  In pancreatic cancer xenografts obtained directly from patients with pancreas cancer, the agent resulted in a marked suppression of tumor growth.  Using a proteomic profiling analysis with isotope tags for relative and absolute quantitation labeling technique, we have identified 20 down-regulated proteins and 42 up-regulated proteins on IPI-504 treatment. tumor growth Identical changes were observed in the expression of the genes coding for these proteins in a subset of proteins including HSPA1B, LGALS3, CALM1, FAM84B, FDPS, GOLPH2, HBA1, HIST1H1C, HLA-B, and MARCKS.  The majority of these proteins belong to the functional class of intracellular signal transduction, immune response, cell growth and maintenance, transport, and metabolism.  Dicoumarol, a long-established oral anticoagulant, is a new Hsp90 inhibitor that represses PTTG1/Securin gene expression and provokes apoptosis through a complex trait involving both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways.  Dicoumarol activity as an Hsp90 inhibitor is confirmed by smaller levels of Hsp90 clients in treated cells and inhibition of in vivo heat shock luciferase activity recovery assays.  Likewise, established Hsp90 inhibitors (17-allylamino-geldanamycin and novobiocin) repress PTTG1/Securin gene expression.   However, effects on PTTG1/Securin could be partially ascribed to inhibition of the Ras/Raf/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway.  To document this field, we have studied two Hsp90 inhibitors (radicicol and geldanamycin), known to interact with the ATP-binding site of Hsp90 (the Bergerat fold), One of these is the novel agent 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin that acts to inhibit the hsp90 molecular chaperone.  Treatment of four human colon cancer cell lines with iso-effective concentrations of this agent resulted in depletion of c-raf-1 and akt and inhibition of signal transduction.  The expression of hsp90 client protein genes was not affected, but hsc hsp70, hsp90beta, keratin 8, keratin 18 and caveolin-1 were deregulated following treatment. 
###question: What is the mode of action of Hsp90 inhibitors?[EOC] [SOR]###response: Pharmacologic inhibition of Hsp90 involves interaction with the ATP-binding site of the chaperone.  This exerts antiproliferative effects resulting in a marked suppression of tumor growth.  Following treatment with a Hsp90 inhibitor, expression of a number of proteins is affected, and most notably the Hsp90 clients, leading to dysregulation of intracellular signal transduction, immune response, cell growth and maintenance, transport, and metabolism, finally resulting in cancer cell death through activation of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways.

The two genomes subsequently converged onto similar current sizes (5,600 protein-coding genes each) and independently retained sets of duplicated genes that are strikingly similar.  Almost half of their surviving single-copy genes are not orthologs but paralogs formed by WGD, as would be expected if most gene pairs were resolved independently.

"[SOC]###context: Novel C12orf65 mutations in patients with axonal neuropathy and optic atrophy Charcot-Marie Tooth disease (CMT) forms a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders.  Although a number of disease genes have been identified for CMT, the gene discovery for some complex form of CMT has lagged behind.  The association of neuropathy and optic atrophy (also known as CMT type 6) has been described with autosomaldominant, recessive and X-linked modes of inheritance.  Mutations in Mitofusin 2 have been found to cause dominant forms of CMT6.  Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase-I mutations cause X-linked CMT6, but until now, mutations in the recessive forms of disease have never been identified. METHODS: We here describe a family with three affected individuals who inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion a childhood onset neuropathy and optic atrophy.  Using homozygosity mapping in the family and exome sequencing in two affected individuals we identified a novel protein-truncating mutation in the C12orf65 gene, which encodes for a protein involved in mitochondrial translation Novel C12orf65 mutations in patients with axonal neuropathy and optic atrophy.  Our study broadens the phenotypic spectrum of C12orf65 defects and highlights the triad of optic atrophy, axonal neuropathy and spastic paraparesis as its key clinical features.

"[SOC]###context: Following the 25 d lesion, we administered PLX3397, a CSF1R inhibitor, for 30 d to eliminate microglia.   . METHODS: Using x-ray co-crystallography to guide our drug-discovery research, we generated a potent, selective CSF1R inhibitor, PLX3397, that traps the kinase in the autoinhibited conformation.  Treatment with PLX3397, a small molecule inhibitor of the CSF1 receptor CSF1R and related kinases, decreases microglial numbers by promoting microglial apoptosis in both CSF1 overexpressing and control mice.  Sustained inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinases and macrophage depletion by PLX3397 and rapamycin as a potential new approach for the treatment of MPNSTs.  We hypothesized that PLX3397, which inhibits KIT and colony-stimulating-factor-1 receptor (CSF1R), would be more efficacious than imatinib in GIST by also depleting tumor-associated macrophages, which are generally thought to support tumor growth.  The cytokine CSF-1 (or M-CSF) is an important factor of TAM recruitment and differentiation and several pharmacological agents targeting the CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R) have been developed to regulate TAM in solid cancers.  We show that the kinase inhibitor PLX3397 strongly dampened the systemic and local accumulation of macrophages driven by B16F10 melanomas, without affecting Gr-1(+) myeloid derived suppressor cells.   The CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R) is a tyrosine kinase that is targetable by small molecule inhibitors such as PLX3397.  In conclusion, CSF-1R blockade with PLX3397 improved the efficacy of ACT immunotherapy by inhibiting the intratumoral accumulation of immunosuppressive macrophages.

"[SOC]###context: A history of side effects was reported by 40 (19. 5%) of the patients, and mainly consisted of muscle complaints and gastrointestinal symptoms.   Treatment Options for Statin-Associated Muscle Symptoms.  Muscle symptoms are a clinically relevant side effect of statin treatment.  At least 5% of patients taking statins have statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS).   Muscle problems and other adverse symptoms associated with statin use are frequent reasons for non-adherence and discontinuation of statin therapy, which results in inadequate control of hyperlipidemia and increased cardiovascular risk.   It was estimated that rosuvastatin-associated absolute hazards of muscle-, liver- and renal-related adverse effects are lower than the corresponding vascular benefits in moderate vascular risk individuals.   Rosuvastatin-induced proteinuria appears to be of tubular origin, not relating to kidney injury.  Rosuvastatin increases the risk of new-onset diabetes by dose-dependently impairing insulin sensitivity.   Statins are associated with myopathy, transaminase elevations, and an increased risk of incident diabetes mellitus among some patients; connections between statins and other processes, such as renal and neurologic function, have also been studied with mixed results.   Muscle symptoms are a clinically relevant side effect of statin treatment. This review is based on pertinent publications retrieved by a selective literature search, and on the current recommendations of the European Atherosclerosis Society. At least 5% of patients taking statins have statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS).  Nevertheless, patients may develop side effects such as muscle pain and weakness years after starting statin therapy; however, the absolute number of patients affected by statin myopathy increases with treatment duration.  Better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in statin-induced myopathy may help identify patient groups susceptible to statins' side effects, thereby increasing their safety. .

Clinical features variability between familial and sporadic restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease (RLS/WED) has been previously reported.  With this retrospective cohort study, we aimed to determine the clinical and polysomnographic characteristics of 400 RLS/WED patients.   ""Emplotted Narratives"" and Structured ""Behavioral Observations"" Supporting the Diagnosis of Willis-Ekbom Disease/Restless Legs Syndrome in Children with Neurodevelopmental Conditions.  BACKGROUND: Willis-Ekbom disease/restless legs syndrome (WED/RLS) seems to be a frequent cause of intractable chronic insomnia (ICI) but is under-recognized in children/adolescents with neurodevelopmental conditions (NDCs), as many patients do not have the ability to express the underlying ""urge-to-move"".   Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Willis-Ekbom disease (WED), is a common movement disorder characterised by an uncontrollable urge to move because of uncomfortable, sometimes painful sensations in the legs with a diurnal variation and a release with movement.   OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that having migraine in middle age is related to late-life parkinsonism and a related disorder, restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Willis-Ekbom disease (WED). METHODS: The AGES-Reykjavik cohort (born 1907-1935) has been followed since 1967.

"[SOC]###context: Administration of an ET receptor antagonist, either bosentan or macitentan, markedly attenuated PD-induced MMT, fibrosis, angiogenesis, and peritoneal functional decline.   Macitentan is an oral, once-daily, dual endothelin (ET)A and ETB receptor antagonist with high affinity and sustained receptor binding that was approved in the USA, Europe, Canada, and Switzerland for the treatment of PAH.  Macitentan (Opsumit®) is a novel dual endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) with sustained receptor binding properties developed by Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd.  Macitentan, also called Actelion-1 or ACT-064992 [N-[5-(4-bromophenyl)-6-(2-(5-bromopyrimidin-2-yloxy)ethoxy)-pyrimidin-4-yl]-N'-propylaminosulfonamide], is a new dual ET(A)/ET(B) endothelin (ET) receptor antagonist designed for tissue targeting.  Selection of macitentan was based on inhibitory potency on both ET receptors and optimization of physicochemical properties to achieve high affinity for lipophilic milieu.  In vivo, macitentan is metabolized into a major and pharmacologically active metabolite, ACT-132577.   Macitentan and its metabolite antagonized the specific binding of ET-1 on membranes of cells overexpressing ET(A) and ET(B) receptors and blunted ET-1-induced calcium mobilization in various natural cell lines, with inhibitory constants within the nanomolar range.  In functional assays, macitentan and ACT-132577 inhibited ET-1-induced contractions in isolated endothelium-denuded rat aorta (ET(A) receptors) and sarafotoxin S6c-induced contractions in isolated rat trachea (ET(B) receptors).  In rats with pulmonary hypertension, macitentan prevented both the increase of pulmonary pressure and the right ventricle hypertrophy, and it markedly improved survival.   In conclusion, macitentan, by its tissue-targeting properties and dual antagonism of ET receptors, protects against end-organ damage in diabetes and improves survival in pulmonary hypertensive rats.  This profile makes macitentan a new agent to treat cardiovascular disorders associated with chronic tissue ET system activation.  Pharmacology of macitentan, an orally active tissue-targeting dual endothelin receptor antagonist.  Renal, retinal and cardiac changes in type 2 diabetes are attenuated by macitentan, a dual endothelin receptor antagonist.  Here we investigated the effects of macitentan, an orally-active, tissue-targeting dual ET receptor antagonist on chronic complications in type 2 diabetes. MAIN METHODS: db/db mice and their age- and sex-matched controls were examined after 2 and 4 months of diabetes.   Macitentan is a novel dual ETA/ETB receptor antagonist with enhanced tissue distribution and sustained receptor binding properties designed to achieve a more efficacious ET receptor blockade.   Recently oral prostacyclin receptor agonists have shown encouraging results.  Many clinical studies targeting the vasoconstrictor ET-1 pathway with receptor antagonists like bosentan and ambrisentan have shown strong results, even more optimism coming from macitentan, the newest drug.

Recently, the development of the most promising agent in this class, eprotirome, was halted over toxicology concerns following long-term canine studies.  Consequently, the future of contemporary TRβ agonists is unclear.   We designed novel thyromimetics with high receptor (TRβ) and organ (liver) selectivity based on the structure of eprotirome (3) and molecular modeling.   In humans, eprotirome exerts favorable lipid-modulating effects while lacking thyroid hormone-related side-effects and maintaining normal hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid feedback.

Eosinophilia (sometimes exceeding 50%) is often present in patients with acute schistosomiasis (Katayama fever), but may be limited or absent in late fibrotic manifestations of the disease.  Laboratory diagnosis of schistosomiasis and Katayama syndrome in returning travellers The specific diagnosis of early schistosomiasis and Katayama fever relies essentially on serologic tests or preferably on PCR (if available).   BACKGROUND: Katayama fever is an acute clinical condition characterised by high fever, dry cough and general malaise occurring during early Schistosoma spp.  infection.  Schistosomiasis is a helminthic infection that is endemic in tropical and subtropical regions.  In Africa, it predominantly manifests as urogenital disease, and the main infective agent is Schistosoma hematobium.  His symptoms were caused by acute invasive schistosomiasis, also known as Katayama fever.

"[SOC]###context: Coilin is widely known as the protein marker of the Cajal body, a subnuclear domain important to the biogenesis of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins and telomerase, complexes that are crucial to pre-messenger RNA splicing and telomere maintenance, respectively Extensive studies have characterized the interaction between coilin and the various other protein components of CBs and related subnuclear domains; however, only a few have examined interactions between coilin and nucleic acid.  coilin is tightly associated with nucleic acid, displays RNase activity in vitro, and is redistributed to the ribosomal RNA (rRNA)-rich nucleoli in cells treated with the DNA-damaging agents cisplatin and etoposide Here, we report a specific in vivo association between coilin and rRNA, U small nuclear RNA (snRNA), and human telomerase RNA, which is altered upon treatment with DNA-damaging agents.  Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we provide evidence of coilin interaction with specific regions of U snRNA gene loci.  Additionally, we provide evidence of coilin involvement in the processing of human telomerase RNA both in vitro and in vivo.  Coilin, more than a molecular marker of the cajal (coiled) body The Cajal body has now regained the interest of biologists, due to the isolation of a protein marker, coilin.  Here, I would like to discuss what we have learned about coilin and suggest a possible role for coilin in RNA processing and cellular trafficking, especially in relation to Cajal bodies and nucleoli.   Coilin-p80 is a marker protein for nuclear Cajal bodies (coiled bodies; CBs) which are also involved in snRNP maturation, storage or transport.  Coilin is another nuclear SMN binding partner and a marker protein for Cajal bodies (CBs).  A limited set of NBs also contained coilin, a marker protein for Cajal bodies (CBs).  We performed a genome-wide screen to identify proteins that colocalize with coilin, the marker protein of Cajal bodies.  Coilin is a marker protein for subnuclear organelles known as Cajal bodies, which are sites of various RNA metabolic processes including the biogenesis of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles.  Coilin is a marker protein for the Cajal body, a subnuclear domain acting as a site for assembly and maturation of nuclear RNA-protein complexes.  We performed a genome-wide screen to identify proteins that colocalize with coilin, the marker protein of Cajal bodies Cajal bodies (CB) are subnuclear domains that contain various proteins with diverse functions including the CB marker protein coilin Coilin is another nuclear SMN binding partner and a marker protein for Cajal bodies (CBs) One of these target proteins is coilin; a basic protein located in nuclear Cajal bodies Coilin is known as the marker protein for Cajal bodies (CBs), subnuclear domains important for the biogenesis of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) which function in pre-mRNA splicing.  Cajal bodies (coiled bodies, CBs) are nuclear organelles of unknown function and are characterized by a wide variety of components including various basal transcription and cell cycle proteins, the nucleolar proteins fibrillarin and Nopp140, numerous small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, the survival motor neuron protein complex, and the marker protein, p80 coilin.  Perturbation of SMN function results in disassembly of Cajal bodies and relocalization of the marker protein, coilin, to nucleoli.  Human coilin interacting nuclear ATPase protein (hCINAP) directly interacts with coilin, a marker protein of Cajal Bodies (CBs), nuclear organelles involved in the maturation of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins UsnRNPs and snoRNPs.  hCINAP has previously been designated as an adenylate kinase (AK6), but is very atypical as it exhibits unusually broad substrate specificity, structural features characteristic of ATPase/GTPase proteins (Walker motifs A and B) and also intrinsic ATPase activity.  Coilin is another nuclear SMN binding partner and a marker protein for Cajal bodies (CBs).  Cajal bodies (CB) are subnuclear domains that contain various proteins with diverse functions including the CB marker protein coilin.  We have found that coilin, the marker protein for Cajal bodies (coiled bodies, CBs), is a self-interacting protein, and we have mapped the domain responsible for this activity to the amino-terminus.  Cajal bodies contain a marker protein of unknown function, p80-coilin, and many components involved in transcription and processing of nuclear RNAs.  We performed a genome-wide screen to identify proteins that colocalize with coilin, the marker protein of Cajal bodies.  A defect in this activity caused a significant accumulation of the Cajal body marker protein coilin in nucleoli.  Coilin, more than a molecular marker of the cajal (coiled) body.  We have constructed a stable HeLa cell line, HeLa(GFP-coilin), that expresses the Cajal body marker protein, p80 coilin, fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP-coilin).  The Cajal body, originally identified over 100 years ago as a nucleolar accessory body in neurons, has come to be identified with nucleoplasmic structures, often quite tiny, that contain coiled threads of the marker protein, coilin.  By immunoprecipitation we find that WRAP53 associates with the Cajal body marker coilin, the splicing regulatory protein SMN, and the nuclear import receptor importinβ, and that WRAP53 is essential for complex formation between SMN-coilin and SMN-importinβ. 
###question: Which protein is the main marker of Cajal bodies?[EOC] [SOR]###response: Coilin is widely known as the protein marker of the Cajal body, a subnuclear domain important to the biogenesis of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins and telomerase, complexes that are crucial to pre-messenger RNA splicing and telomere maintenance, respectively The Cajal body has now regained the interest of biologists, due to the isolation of a protein marker, coilin.

"[SOC]###context: The expression levels of related adipocyte markers (PPARγ, C/EBPα), mature white adipose tissue specific markers (Cidec, RIP140) increased at the presence of NPY (10(-7), 10(-9), 10(-11) mol/L).  The cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor alpha-like effector c (CIDEC; also known in rodents as FSP27 or fat-specific protein 27) is a lipid droplet-associated protein that promotes intracellular triglyceride (TAG) storage.  CIDEC/Fsp27 is highly expressed in adipose tissue, but undetectable in normal liver.  However, its hepatic expression rises during fasting or under genetic or diet-induced hepatosteatosis in both mice and patients.    Our results also suggest that patients taking fibrates likely have elevated levels of hepatic CIDEC, which may limit the efficient mobilization and catabolism of hepatic TAGs.  Fat-specific protein 27 (FSP27, CIDEC in humans) is a lipid-coating protein highly expressed in mature white adipocytes that contributes to unilocular lipid droplet formation.  We studied mouse models and human tissues to identify molecules associated with ASH progression and focused on the mouse fat-specific protein 27 (FSP-27)/human cell death-inducing DFF45-like effector C (CIDEC) protein, which is expressed in white adipose tissues and promotes formation of fat droplets.  Hepatic CIDEC mRNA expression was increased in patients with AH and correlated with the degree of hepatic steatosis and disease severity including mortality.  Hepatic expression of FSP27/CIDEC is highly up-regulated in mice following chronic-plus-binge ethanol feeding and in patients with AH; this up-regulation contributes to alcohol-induced liver damage.  FSP27 [cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector c (CIDEC) in humans] is a protein associated with lipid droplets that downregulates the fatty acid oxidation (FAO) rate when it is overexpressed.  Fsp27/CIDEC is a CREB target gene induced during early fasting in liver and regulated by FA oxidation rate.  Similarly, CIDEC expression was upregulated in HepG2 cells by either etomoxir or HMGCS2 interference.  Our data indicate that there is a kinetic mechanism of autoregulation between short- and long-term fasting, by which free FAs delivered to the liver during early fasting are accumulated/exported by FSP27/CIDEC, whereas over longer periods of fasting, they are degraded in the mitochondria through the carnitine palmitoyl transferase system.  However, in adipose tissue the changes in Cidec mRNA did not correspond to the changes in Cidec protein levels, as a HFD decreased Cidec protein abundance.  Cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector c (CIDEC) protein, also known as fat specific protein 27 (Fsp27), is localized to lipid droplets.  We studied mouse models and human tissues to identify molecules associated with ASH progression and focused on the mouse fat-specific protein 27 (FSP-27)/human cell death-inducing DFF45-like effector C (CIDEC) protein, which is expressed in white adipose tissues and promotes formation of fat droplets.  Interestingly, in adipose tissue Cidea protein expression was significantly related to body weight (R=. 725), epididymal adipose tissue (EWAT) mass (R=. 475) and insulin resistance (R=. 706), whereas Cidec protein expression was inversely related to body weight (R=-. 787), EWAT mass (R=-. 706), and insulin resistance (R=-. 679).  Similar to adipose tissue, Cidea protein expression in liver was significantly related to body weight (R=. 660), EWAT mass (R=. 468), and insulin resistance (R=. 599); however, unlike adipose tissue, Cidec protein levels in liver were not related to body weight or EWAT mass and only moderately associated with insulin resistance (R=-. 422, P=0. 051).  The CIDEC protein is located in lipid droplets (LDs) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is induced in fat deposition.  CIDEC protein is required for unilocular lipid droplet formation and optimal energy storage in addition to controlling lipid metabolism in adipocytes and hepatocytes.  Similarly, CIDEC expression was upregulated in HepG2 cells by either etomoxir or HMGCS2 interference.  The hepatic expression of the cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor A-like effector family (CIDEA, CIDEB, and CIDEC) genes is markedly upregulated in mouse models of obesity.  After the differentiation of adipocyte, the expression pattern of Cidec was similar to that of PPARgamma2.  This paper examined the tissue expression profile of CIDEC gene in cattle using real-time RT-PCR to suggest that bovine CIDEC is highly expressed in adipose tissue.  Human adipocytes express high levels of two distinct lipid droplet proteins, fat specific protein 27 (FSP27; also called CIDEC), a member of the CIDE family, and perilipin1 (PLIN1), a member of the PAT family These results suggest that insulin regulates CIDEA and CIDEC expression via PI3K, and it regulates expression of each protein via Akt1/2- and JNK2-dependent pathways, respectively, in human adipocytes.  Differential regulation of CIDEA and CIDEC expression by insulin via Akt1/2- and JNK2-dependent pathways in human adipocytes.  Differential roles of CIDEA and CIDEC in insulin-induced anti-apoptosis and lipid droplet formation in human adipocytes.  Human adipocytes express high levels of two distinct lipid droplet proteins, fat specific protein 27 (FSP27; also called CIDEC), a member of the CIDE family, and perilipin1 (PLIN1), a member of the PAT family.   Fat-specific protein 27 (FSP27, CIDEC in humans) is a lipid-coating protein highly expressed in mature white adipocytes that contributes to unilocular lipid droplet formation.   Using human primary pre-adipocytes, we confirmed that the expression of CIDEC was elevated during the differentiation of pre-adipocytes, and knockdown of CIDEC in human primary pre-adipocytes resulted in differentiation defects.   Cell death-inducing DFF45-like effector C (CIDEC) is a lipid droplet-coating protein that promotes triglyceride accumulation and inhibits lipolysis.  The cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor alpha-like effector c (CIDEC; also known in rodents as FSP27 or fat-specific protein 27) is a lipid droplet-associated protein that promotes intracellular triglyceride (TAG) storage.  Here we demonstrate that knockdown of the lipid droplet protein FSP27 (a. k. a.  CIDEC) in human adipocytes increases expression of ATGL at the level of transcription, whereas overexpression of FSP27 has the opposite effect.  However, the transcriptional regulation of Cidec in adipocyte remains unknown.  Moreover, the hepatic expression of CIDEC is downregulated by marked weight loss.  These data demonstrate that, consistent with previous studies conducted in rodents, hepatic expression of CIDEA and CIDEC, but not CIDEB, is increased in obese humans.  Transcriptional activation of Cidec by PPARgamma2 in adipocyte.  Our data indicated additional fatty acids stimulated hepatic CIDEC expression and an increasing level of CIDEC induced hepatic LD fusion and lipid accumulation.  We studied mouse models and human tissues to identify molecules associated with ASH progression and focused on the mouse fat-specific protein 27 (FSP-27)/human cell death-inducing DFF45-like effector C (CIDEC) protein, which is expressed in white adipose tissues and promotes formation of fat droplets.  By analysis of CIDEC expression in 65 human tissues, we conclude that human CIDEC is predominantly expressed in subcutaneous adipocytes.  CIDEC/Fsp27 is highly expressed in adipose tissue, but undetectable in normal liver.  Interestingly, FSP27/CIEDC was expressed in mouse and human livers and was upregulated in obese C57BL/6J mice.  However, in adipose tissue the changes in Cidec mRNA did not correspond to the changes in Cidec protein levels, as a HFD decreased Cidec protein abundance.

How BACKGROUND: Disease Activity Score in 28 Joints (DAS28) is a scoring system to evaluate disease activity and treatment response in rheumatoid arth METHODS: Functional disability [Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)], disease activity [28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28)], and radiographic joint damage [Sharp/van der Heijde score (SHS)] were measured in 4 consecutive randomized controlled trials with increasingly intensive (tight control) treatment strategies.  INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to determine a low disease activity threshold--a 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28) value--for the decision to maintain unchanged disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) treatment in rheumatoid arthritis patients, based on expert opinion.  Comparison of Disease Activity Score in 28 joints with ESR (DAS28), Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI), Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) & Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data with 3 measures (RAPID3) for assessing disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis at initial presentation.  We assessed achievement of remission as defined by Boolean criteria, Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI), Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI), and 28-joint Disease Activity Score using C-reactive protein (DAS28[CRP]) and determined the components that limit patients in SDAI, CDAI, or DAS28(CRP) remission from achieving Boolean remission.  METHODS: Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) scores, Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) scores, and the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) were calculated using data from tocilizumab trials in patients with RA in whom disease had remained active despite treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.  OBJECTIVE: We used the 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) and the European League Against Rheumatism Sjögren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) articular domain to assess the effect of rituximab (RTX) and abatacept (ABA) on articular involvement in primary Sjögren syndrome (pSS).  METHOD: The clinical data of 189 consecutive RA patients, including RAPID3 questionnaire, Disease Activity Score based on 28-joint count (DAS28), clinical disease activity index (CDAI) and simplified disease activity index (SDAI), and ultrasonography of hand and wrist joints were collected.  Disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28)-remission has not been included among American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism definitions, because of its association with significant residual disease activity, partly due to high weighting of acute-phase reactants (APR).  OBJECTIVE: To examine the influence of components of the Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) [tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), patient's general health (GH), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)] on the total DAS28 score, and overlapping of the 4 individual components in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients with low, moderate, or high disease activity.  This study investigates if, and to what extent, non-adherence to treatment would lead to a higher 28-joint count disease activity score (DAS28) in the first year after diagnosis.  Radiographs of hands and feet, pain, and the modified 28 joint disease activity score (DAS28) were also assessed.  Tender-/swollen-joint count, Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI), Disease Activity Score 28-ESR (DAS28-ESR), DAS28-CRP, Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) and DAS28-monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (DAS28-MCP-1) scores were obtained every 3 months.  METHOD: All patients were naïve to biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) and in low or moderate Disease Activity Score of 28 joints with C-reactive protein (DAS)28-CRP).

"[SOC]###context: Relaxation of selective constraints causes independent selenoprotein extinction in insect genomes.  Selenoproteins are a diverse family of proteins notable for the presence of the 21st amino acid, selenocysteine.  Until very recently, all metazoan genomes investigated encoded selenoproteins, and these proteins had therefore been believed to be essential for animal life.  Challenging this assumption, recent comparative analyses of insect genomes have revealed that some insect genomes appear to have lost selenoprotein genes.   In this paper we investigate in detail the fate of selenoproteins, and that of selenoprotein factors, in all available arthropod genomes.  We use a variety of in silico comparative genomics approaches to look for known selenoprotein genes and factors involved in selenoprotein biosynthesis.  We have found that five insect species have completely lost the ability to encode selenoproteins and that selenoprotein loss in these species, although so far confined to the Endopterygota infraclass, cannot be attributed to a single evolutionary event, but rather to multiple, independent events.  Loss of selenoproteins and selenoprotein factors is usually coupled to the deletion of the entire no-longer functional genomic region, rather than to sequence degradation and consequent pseudogenisation.  Such dynamics of gene extinction are consistent with the high rate of genome rearrangements observed in Drosophila.  Selenoproteins have been independently lost in several insect species, possibly as a consequence of the relaxation in insects of the selective constraints acting across metazoans to maintain selenoproteins.  The dispensability of selenoproteins in insects may be related to the fundamental differences in antioxidant defense between these animals and other metazoans. 
###question: Which metazaon species or taxa are known to lack selenoproteins[EOC] [SOR]###response: Some insect genomes have lost the capacity of synthesizing selenoproteins.  Several insect species without selenoproteins have been identified. [EOR]"
"[SOC]###context: Similarities between the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Nuclear Protein EBNA1 and the Pioneer Transcription Factor FoxA: Is EBNA1 a ""Bookmarking"" Oncoprotein that Alters the Host Cell Epigenotype? In this overview we focus, however, on the epigenetic alterations elicited by EBNA1 by drawing a parallel between EBNA1 and the FoxA family of pioneer transcription factors.  Both EBNA1 and FoxA induce local DNA demethylation, nucleosome destabilization and bind to mitotic chromosomes.   In addition, EBNA1 and FoxA, when associated with mitotic chromatin may ""bookmark"" active genes and ensure their reactivation in postmitotic cells (epigenetic memory) about one-third of the FoxA bound sites are near silent genes, including genes without detectable RNA polymerase II.  We found one such target site at a cryptic ""shadow"" enhancer 7 kilobases (kb) downstream of the Cdx2 gene, where Rfx1 restricts transcriptional activation by FoxA Nuclear mobility and mitotic chromosome binding: similarities between pioneer transcription factor FoxA and linker histone H1 The results indicate that the ""pioneer"" features of FoxA factors involve various chromatin-binding parameters seen in linker histones and that distinguish the factors with respect to their regulatory and mechanistic functions.  These discoveries followed the establishment of the conceptional framework of the mechanism of action of the FoxA proteins as 'pioneer factors' that can engage chromatin before other transcription factors.  The purpose of this review is to critically examine the literature on three highly potent transcriptional activators: the herpes virus protein, VP16; the master regulator of skeletal muscle differentiation, MyoD and the ""pioneer"" factor for hepatogenesis, FoxA.  Nucleosome-binding affinity as a primary determinant of the nuclear mobility of the pioneer transcription factor FoxA We find that slower nuclear mobility correlates with high nonspecific nucleosome binding, and point mutations that disrupt nonspecific binding markedly increase nuclear mobility.  FoxA's distinct nuclear mobility is consistent with its pioneer activity in chromatin The Fox DNA-binding domain structurally resembles linker histone and binds nucleosomes stably Insight into the unique molecular basis of Foxa function has been obtained from recent genetic and genomic data, which identify the Foxa proteins as 'pioneer factors' whose binding to promoters and enhancers enable chromatin access for other tissue-specific transcription factors Nucleosome-binding affinity as a primary determinant of the nuclear mobility of the pioneer transcription factor FoxA.  FOXO proteins represent a hybrid subclass having dual roles as pioneering factors and transcription factors.  A subset of FOX proteins interacts with condensed mitotic chromatin and may function as &apos;bookmarking&apos; agents to maintain transcriptional competence at specific genomic sites.  There exists a hierarchy by which transcription factors can engage their target sites in chromatin, in that a subset of factors can bind transcriptionally silent, nucleosomal DNA, whereas most factors cannot, and this hierarchy is reflected, at least in part, in the developmental function of the factors.

"[SOC]###context: Cilengitide inhibits attachment and invasion of malignant pleural mesothelioma cells through antagonism of integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5.  Also, this dimer bound 3650-fold stronger and inhibited tumor cell migration and proliferation compared with cilengitide, an integrin-targeting peptidomimetic that performed poorly in recent clinical trials, suggesting promise for further therapeutic development.  As there is evidence for expression of the integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5 in MPM, there is a rationale for investigating the effects on MPM of cilengitide, a synthetic peptide inhibitor of integrin αv heterodimer with high specificity for αvβ3 and αvβ5.   Gene knockdown experiments indicated that these effects of cilengitide were, at least partly, due to antagonism of αvβ3 and αvβ5.  Abstract The RGD cyclic pentapetide, cilengitide, is a selective inhibitor of αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins and was developed for antiangiogenic therapy.   Cilengitide is an RGD-peptide of sequence cyclo[RGDfNMeV] that was was developed as a highly active and selective ligand for the αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrin receptors.  RESULTS: αvβ5 was the predominantly expressed integrin heterodimer in meningiomas, whereas αvβ3 was mainly detected in tumor blood vessels.  Application of up to 100 μg/mL cilengitide resulted in only mildly reduced proliferation/survival of meningioma cell lines.   UW479 cells expressed only αvβ5 integrin and were not sensitive to cilengitide, suggesting that cilengitide's action largely depends on αvβ3 inhibition.  Cilengitide's action on glioma and neuroblastoma cells appears to be dependent on αvβ3 expression and sensitivity to anoikis.   METHODS: For this purpose, nude rats bearing bone metastases were treated with cilengitide, a small molecule inhibitor of αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins, from day 30 to 55 after tumor cell inoculation of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (25 mg/kg, 5 days per week; n = 8 rats) and compared to control rats (n = 8).   The αVβ3/αVβ5 integrin inhibitor cilengitide augments tumor response to melphalan isolated limb perfusion in a sarcoma model.  Cilengitide, a cyclized Arg-Gly-Glu(RGD)-containing pentapeptide that selectively blocks activation of the αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins has shown encouraging activity in patients with glioblastoma as single agent, and in association with standard RT and temozolomide.    Aza-amino acid scanning was performed on the cyclic RGD-peptide Cilengitide, cyclo[R-G-D-f-N(Me)V] 1, and its parent peptide cyclo(R-G-D-f-V) 2, potent antagonists of the αvβ3, αvβ5, and α5β1 integrin receptors, which play important roles in human tumor metastasis and tumor-induced angiogenesis.   Cilengitide (EMD121974; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) is a new drug targeting αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins thanks to a specific peptide called RGD sequence.   Cilengitide, a cyclic RGD-mimetic peptide of αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins is in advanced clinical development in glioblastoma.  The purpose of this study was the assessment of the feasibility of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) studies with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) to quantify effects of the cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp peptide cilengitide, which targets the ανβ 3 and ανβ 5 integrin receptors in rats with breast cancer bone metastases.   We conducted a phase II study of cilengitide, a selective antagonist of α(v)β(3) and α(v)β(5) integrins, in non-metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer with rising PSA.   AlphaVbeta3 and alphaVbeta5 integrins are overexpressed on both glioma cells and tumor vasculature.  Cilengitide, the most advanced specific integrin inhibitor in oncology, has shown antitumor activity against glioma in early clinical trials.   The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of inhibiting αvβ(3)/α(v) β(5) integrins by cilengitide in experimentally induced breast cancer bone metastases using noninvasive imaging techniques.  For this purpose, nude rats bearing established breast cancer bone metastases were treated with cilengitide, a small molecule inhibitor of αvβ(3) and αvβ(5) integrins (75 mg/kg, five days per week; n = 12 rats) and compared to vehicle-treated control rats (n = 12).    In conclusion, treatment of experimental breast cancer bone metastases with cilengitide resulted in pronounced antiresorptive and antitumor effects, suggesting that αvβ(3)/αvβ(5) inhibition may be a promising therapeutic approach for bone metastases.  Integrin antagonists, including the alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 inhibitor cilengitide, have shown encouraging activity in Phase II clinical trials and cilengitide is currently being tested in a Phase III trial in patients with glioblastoma.   Cilengitide (cyclic peptidic alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 antagonist) is currently in clinical trials for anti cancer therapy.  PURPOSE: Cilengitide, an inhibitor of alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrin receptors, demonstrated minimal toxicity and durable activity across a wide range of doses administered to adults with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in a prior phase I study.   In line with this concept, peptide ligands containing the Arginine-Glycine-Aspartate (RGD) triad, which display a strong affinity and selectivity to the alpha(V)beta(3) integrin, have been developed to target the tumor-associated cells expressing the alpha (V)beta (3) receptors.  Among the validated ligands, the leader compound is the cyclic pentapeptide c[-RGDf(NMe)V-] (Cilengitide) developed by kessler et al.  (J.  Med.  Chem. , 1999, 42, 3033-3040).   Assessment of the biological and pharmacological effects of the alpha nu beta3 and alpha nu beta5 integrin receptor antagonist, cilengitide (EMD 121974), in patients with advanced solid tumors.  BACKGROUND: Cilengitide, an antiangiogenic agent that inhibits the binding of integrins alpha(nu)beta(3) and alpha(nu)beta(5) to the extracellular matrix, was studied at two dose levels in cancer patients to determine the optimal biological dose.   Cilengitide (EMD121974; NSC 707544), is a potent selective alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrin antagonist.   Phase I and pharmacokinetic study of continuous twice weekly intravenous administration of Cilengitide (EMD 121974), a novel inhibitor of the integrins alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 in patients with advanced solid tumours.  A single-agent dose escalating phase I and pharmacokinetic study with Cilengitide, an inhibitor of the integrins alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5, was performed to determine its safety and toxicity.   This study was designed to determine whether, and how, the cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp peptide Cilengitide (EMD 121974), which targets the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin receptor expressed on neovasculature, could increase systemic RIT efficacy of therapy in a human breast cancer tumor model having mutant p53 and expressing bcl-2.   The purpose of this study was the assessment of the feasibility of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) studies with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) to quantify effects of the cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp peptide cilengitide, which targets the ανβ 3 and ανβ 5 integrin receptors in rats with breast cancer bone metastases

"[SOC]###context: Genetic deficits and loss of function for the triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells 2 (TREM2; encoded at chr6p21. 1), a transmembrane spanning stimulatory receptor of the immunoglobulin/lectin-like gene superfamily, have been associated with deficiencies in phagocytosis and the innate immune system in Alzheimer's disease.  Recent works have demonstrated a rare functional variant (R47H) in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) 2 gene, encoding TREM2 protein, increase susceptibility to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), possible involvement of TREM2 in AD pathogenesis.  TREM2 is associated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease in Spanish population.  Two recent studies have reported the association of rs75932628-T in the TREM2 gene with the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD).  we report the first positive replication study in a Spanish population and confirm that TREM2 rs75932628-T is associated with the risk for AD.  (TREM2) has recently been identified as a rare risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD).  In this study we examined the association between TREM2 exon 2 variants and early-onset AD in a sample of Caucasian subjects of French origin including 726 patients with age of onset ≤65 years and 783 controls.  We found significantly more variants in exon 2 of TREM2 in patients with Alzheimer's disease than in controls in the discovery set The most commonly associated variant, rs75932628 (encoding R47H), showed highly significant association with Alzheimer's disease (P<0. 001).  Our findings strongly implicate variant TREM2 in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.  Given the reported antiinflammatory role of TREM2 in the brain, the R47H substitution may lead to an increased predisposition to Alzheimer's disease Recent works have demonstrated a rare functional variant (R47H) in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) 2 gene, encoding TREM2 protein, increase susceptibility to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), with an odds ratio similar to that of the apolipoprotein E ε4 allele.  The rs75932628-T variant of the gene encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) has recently been identified as a rare risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD).  BACKGROUND: Homozygous loss-of-function mutations in TREM2, encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 protein, have previously been associated with an autosomal recessive form of early-onset dementia.  CONCLUSIONS: Heterozygous rare variants in TREM2 are associated with a significant increase in the risk of Alzheimer's disease.  RESULTS: A rare missense mutation (rs75932628-T) in the gene encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), which was predicted to result in an R47H substitution, was found to confer a significant risk of Alzheimer's disease in Iceland (odds ratio, 2. 92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2. 09 to 4. 09; P=3. 42×10(-10)).

destroy the lymphatics buprenorphine may play an important role in the puffy hand sign although it is supposed to be administered orally many drug addicts use it as an i v solution because buprenorphine is poorly soluble it causes lymphatic obstruction this type of hand for which no therapy exists must be differentiated from deep palmar space infection with dorsal edema which requires

"[SOC]###context: Amongst the ditans, lasmiditan: (i) fails to constrict human coronary arteries; and (ii) is effective for the acute treatment of migraine in preliminary Phase III clinical trials.  Although ongoing phase III clinical trials are needed to confirm its efficacy and safety, lasmiditan might offer an alternative to treat acute migraine with no associated cardiovascular risk.  Lasmiditan is considered to be the first member of a new drug category, the neurally acting anti-migraine agent (NAAMA) Lasmiditan for the treatment of acute migraine: a review and potential role in clinical practice.  Lasmiditan, a highly selective 5-HT1F agonist, has completed two Phase III randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, with a third - a long-term, open-label safety study - still underway.  Research to date suggests lasmiditan lacks vasoconstrictive properties and may be a safe and effective treatment option in patients refractory to current acute migraine medications or who have cardiovascular risk factors.  Lasmiditan is an effective acute treatment for migraine: A phase 3 randomized study.  Compared with placebo, more patients dosed with lasmiditan 200 mg were free of headache pain at 2 hours after dosing (32. 2% vs 15. 3%; odds ratio [OR] 2. 6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2. 0-3. 6, p< 0. 001), similar to those dosed with lasmiditan 100 mg (28. 2%; OR 2. 2, 95% CI 1. 6-3. 0, p< 0. 001).  Furthermore, compared with those dosed with placebo, more patients dosed with lasmiditan 200 mg (40. 7% vs 29. 5%; OR 1. 6, 95% CI 1. 3-2. 1, p< 0. 001) and lasmiditan 100 mg (40. 9%; OR 1. 7, 95% CI, 1. 3-2. 2, p< 0. 001) were free of their MBS at 2 hours after dosing.  CONCLUSIONS: Lasmiditan dosed at 200 and 100 mg was efficacious and well tolerated in the treatment of acute migraine among patients with a high level of cardiovascular risk factors CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class I evidence that for adult patients with migraine, lasmiditan increases the proportion of subjects who are headache pain free at 2 hours after treating a migraine attack.  For the understanding of migraine pathophysiology, it is very important to note that a selective 5-HT(1F) receptor agonist like lasmiditan is effective in the acute treatment of migraine.   While lasmiditan most likely is effective in the treatment of migraine attacks it had, unfortunately, a high incidence of CNS related AEs in the oral RCT.   Acute treatment of migraine with the selective 5-HT1F receptor agonist lasmiditan--a randomised proof-of-concept trial. At intravenous doses of 20 mg and higher, lasmiditan proved effective in the acute treatment of migraine.   Lasmiditan for the treatment of acute migraine: a review and potential role in clinical practice.   BACKGROUND Lasmiditan (COL-144) is a novel, centrally acting, highly selective 5-HT(1F) receptor agonist without vasoconstrictor activity that seemed effective when given as an intravenous infusion in a proof-of-concept migraine study.  INTERPRETATION Oral lasmiditan seems to be safe and effective in the acute treatment of migraine.  The 5-HT1F receptor agonist lasmiditan, a drug acting through non-vasoconstrictive mechanisms, represents a promising safe, effective and tolerated acute migraine therapy also for patients at cardiovascular risk.

The 5-HT1F receptor agonist lasmiditan as a potential treatment of migraine attacks: a review of two placebo-controlled phase II trials.  Within the past few years, new and promising drugs such as more specific 5-HT 1F receptor agonists (that is, lasmiditan) and monoclonal calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antibodies entered advanced development phases while non-invasive neuromodulatory approaches were suggested to be potentially effective as non-pharmaceutical interventions for migraine.

"[SOC]###context: Long-term use of desvenlafaxine was safe and well tolerated, with a clinical benefit/risk profile similar to that in other populations.  e objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term safety of desvenlafaxine for continuation treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in Japanese patients.  This was a phase 3, multicenter, 10-month, open-label study with flexible dosing of desvenlafaxine (25, 50, 100 mg/day) n an effort to establish the lowest effective dose of desvenlafaxine (administered as desvenlafaxine succinate), we assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 10- and 50-mg/day desvenlafaxine vs placebo for the treatment of major depressive disorder Change from baseline to final evaluation in adjusted HAM-D(17) total scores was not significantly different comparing desvenlafaxine 10 mg/day (-9. 28) and desvenlafaxine 50 mg/day (-8. 92) with placebo (-8. 42) Overall rates of treatment-emergent adverse events with both doses were similar to placebo However, in a companion study reported separately, desvenlafaxine 50 mg, but not 25 mg, separated from placebo.  Taken together, these studies suggest that 50 mg is the minimum effective dose of desvenlafaxine for the treatment of major depressive disorder.   Desvenlafaxine XR was dosed at 50 mg/day for 10 days.  Desvenlafaxine therapy is initiated at the therapeutic dose (50 mg/day) without a need for dose titration.  Clinical studies have investigated the efficacy of DVS in doses ranging from 50 to 400 mg/day for the treatment of MDD in adult outpatients.  The effects of DVS 50 mg/day have been clearly distinguished from placebo in the reduction of MDD symptoms in such clinical trials.  No additional therapeutic benefits were found at doses > 50 mg/day.  The recommended dose of DVS ranges from 50 to 100 mg.  Adult outpatients with major depressive disorder received desvenlafaxine doses ranging from 50-400 mg/day or placebo for 8 weeks  At the recommended therapeutic dose of 50 mg/day, discontinuation due to adverse events was similar to placebo atients received fixed (50, 100, 200, or 400 mg/day; n=1,342) or flexible doses (100-400 mg/day; n=463) of desvenlafaxine or placebo (n=1,108) Desvenlafaxine demonstrated short-term efficacy for treating major depressive disorder across the range of doses studied.  No evidence of greater efficacy was observed with doses >50 mg/day; a strong dose-response effect on tolerability was observed.  To assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 50- and 100-mg/day doses of desvenlafaxine (administered as desvenlafaxine succinate), a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) Patients with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) MDD and 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D(17)) scores > or =20 were randomly assigned to double-blind placebo or desvenlafaxine treatment (fixed dose of 50 mg/day or 100 mg/day) for 8 weeks.  Desvenlafaxine 50 mg was associated with a significantly greater adjusted mean change from baseline on the HAM-D(17) (-11. 5) compared with placebo (-9. 5, p=0. 018)  These results demonstrate efficacy, safety, and tolerability of desvenlafaxine 50 mg/day for treating MDD.   CONCLUSIONS: Desvenlafaxine at the recommended dose of 50 mg/d was effective in relapse prevention of depression during a 6-month period in patients who demonstrated stable response after 20 weeks of open-label desvenlafaxine treatment.

"[SOC]###context: IRG1 is highly upregulated in murine ANA-1 macrophages by several proinflammatory cytokines and Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, as well as in spleen and lung of Listeria monocytogenes or Toxoplasma gondii infected mice, respectively The proinflammatory cytokine-induced IRG1 protein associates with mitochondria multiple genes induced by Borrelia burgdorferi in macrophages to regulate Lyme disease inflammation One of these genes, IRG1, was confirmed by single nucleotide polymorphism analysis to be involved in susceptibility.  Its precise mechanism remains to be elucidated, although the analysis of gene expression data suggests it has a role in apoptosis.  Murine immune-responsive gene 1 (IRG1) plays significant roles in embryonic implantation and neurodegeneration the IRG1 gene is differentially expressed in human fetal PBMCs and LPS-stimulated adult PBMCs.  we identified the immune-responsive gene 1 (IRG1), which was expressed substantially higher in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated than in MAP-infected murine macrophage cell lines.  The inhibitor also blocked induction by LIF of several LIF-regulated genes in the LE including Irg1, which has been shown previously to be essential for implantation.  Immune-responsive gene 1 is a novel target of progesterone receptor and plays a critical role during implantation in the mouse.  our studies identified Irg1 as a novel target of PR in the pregnant uterus and also revealed that it is a critical regulator of the early events leading to implantation  This resulted in the identification of one novel P4-regulated gene that had been previously found in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages and called immune response gene-1 (Irg1) and which is the mammalian ortholog of the bacterial gene encoding methylcitrate dehydratase the mammalian ortholog of methylcitrate dehydratase (immune response gene 1) Here we report the isolation of a complementary DNA representing a novel gene, interferon-regulated gene 1 (IRG1).  T Here we report the isolation of a complementary DNA representing a novel gene, interferon-regulated gene 1 (IRG1).  This gene exhibits significant homology to interferon (IFN)-alpha/beta-inducible human genes p27 and 6-16, indicating that these genes may belong to the same family The level of IRG1 mRNA again rose transiently on day 4 immediately preceding implantation.  Although the functional roles of IRG1 and p27 remain unclear, we describe for the first time, identification of a gene family regulated by IFNalpha in both rodent and human uteri Hence, the induction of IRG1 by LPS is mediated by tyrosine kinase and protein kinase C pathway. 
###question: What is the function of the mammalian gene Irg1?[EOC] [SOR]###response: Human IRG1 and mouse Irg1 mediates antiviral and antimicrobial immune responses, without its exact role having been elucidated.

"[SOC]###context: Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) play increasingly appreciated gene-regulatory roles.  Here, we describe a regulatory network centered on four ncRNAs-a long ncRNA, a circular RNA, and two microRNAs-using gene editing in mice to probe the molecular consequences of disrupting key components of this network.  The long ncRNA Cyrano uses an extensively paired site to miR-7 to trigger destruction of this microRNA.  Cyrano-directed miR-7 degradation is much more effective than previously described examples of target-directed microRNA degradation, which come primarily from studies of artificial and viral RNAs.  By reducing miR-7 levels, Cyrano prevents repression of miR-7-targeted mRNAs and enables accumulation of Cdr1as, a circular RNA known to regulate neuronal activity.  Without Cyrano, excess miR-7 causes cytoplasmic destruction of Cdr1as in neurons, in part through enhanced slicing of Cdr1as by a second miRNA, miR-671.  Thus, several types of ncRNAs can collaborate to establish a sophisticated regulatory network.

"[SOC]###context: The sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 (S1P1) agonist ozanimod ameliorates ulcerative colitis, yet its mechanism of action is unknown.  Finally, the S1P1 receptor agonist ozanimod showed promise in early trials in ulcerative colitis.  ntil recently, three S1P modulators with differing selectivity for S1P receptors were in clinical development for IBD: ozanimod (RPC1063), etrasimod (APD334) and amiselimod (MT-1303).  Ozanimod is an oral selective modulator of S1P1Rand S1P5Rreceptors in clinical development for the treatment of chronic immune-mediated, inflammatory diseases.  Ozanimod is a novel, selective, oral sphingosine-1-phosphate (1 and 5) receptor modulator in development for multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease.   Emerging strategies to interfere with cellular adhesion processes involved in lymphocyte recruitment are discussed, including both integrin blockade (natalizumab, vedolizumab, etrolizumab) and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor inhibition (fingolimod, ozanimod).  RECENT FINDINGS: We discuss the most important findings of one published phase II trial that targeted the β7 integrin (etrolizumab), two phase II trials that targeted the α4β7 integrin ligand: mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1, PF-00547659), a phase II trial targeting the chemokine IP-10 (CXCL10) in Crohn's, and a phase II trial that targeted the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1: ozanimod in patients with ulcerative colitis.

"[SOC]###context: A total of 5. 97 Gb clean data were generated for the two samples, achieving a mean depth of coverage of 31. 96 and 32. 88 for the AAA and normal samples, respectively.  The 1. 7 Mb targeted regions were sequenced with a coverage ranged from 32× to 45× for the 28 genes.  We performed whole-exome sequencing on 87 HCCs and matched normal adjacent tissues to an average coverage of 59× We performed WES (mean coverage approximately 40×) on 10 trios comprised of unaffected parents and a child with sporadic epilepsy characterized by difficult-to-control seizures and some combination of developmental delay, epileptic encephalopathy, autistic features, cognitive impairment, or motor deficits.  Sequence processing and variant calling were performed using standard bioinformatics tools.  Whole-exome sequencing achieved a high degree of coverage such that approximately 97% of targeted bases were represented by more than 10 base reads; AbCD is a user-friendly interface providing pre-estimated effective sample sizes, specific to each minor allele frequency category, for designs with arbitrary coverage (0. 5-30×) and sample size (20-10 000), and for four major ethnic groups (Europeans, Africans, Asians and African Americans).   Next generation sequencing with mean coverage of 50× using the Illumina Hi Seq and whole exome capture processing was performed.  mtDNA genome coverage varied depending on the mtDNA:nuclear blend ratio, where a 1:100 ratio provided optimal dual-genome coverage with 10X coverage for over 97. 5% of all targeted nuclear regions and 1,000X coverage for 99. 8% of the mtDNA genome.  mtDNA mutations were reliably detected to at least an 8% heteroplasmy level, as discriminated both from sequencing errors and potential contamination from nuclear mtDNA transcripts (Numts).  Each sample was sequenced to a mean depth of coverage of greater than 120× Long-PCR targeting was more efficient with up to 94% of USH gene regions displaying an overall coverage higher than 25×, whereas whole exome sequencing yielded a similar coverage for only 50% of those regions.  WES reads covered 91% of the target capture region (of size 37. 2 MB) with an average coverage of 65×.  We captured 162,073 exons of 16,954 genes and sequenced the targeted regions to a mean coverage of 56-fold.  The specificity of exome enrichment was approximately 80% with 95. 6% even coverage of the 34 Mb target region at an average sequencing depth of 33-fold We generated over 4. 7 GB of mappable sequence to a 125X read coverage per sample.

"[SOC]###context: Aggregation of embryonic stem cells induces Nanog repression and primitive endoderm differentiation Interestingly, cell aggregation by itself induced Nanog repression at the outer layer, which was essential for aggregation-induced primitive endoderm formation early embryonic development, when downregulation of Nanog plays a crucial role.  The homeobox gene Nanog is a key intrinsic determinant of self renewal in embryonic stem (ES) cells, and its repression leads ES cells to selectively differentiate into primitive endoderm.  These data indicate that the Grb2/Mek pathway primarily mediates Nanog gene repression upon ES cell differentiation into primitive endoderm.  Nanog and Oct4 associate with unique transcriptional repression complexes in embryonic stem cells Nanog and Oct4 are essential transcription factors that regulate self-renewal and pluripotency of ES cells.   the mechanisms by which Nanog and Oct4 modulate ES cell fate remain unknown.   Nanog, Oct4 and repressor proteins co-occupy Nanog-target genes in mouse ES cells, suggesting that Nanog and Oct4 together may communicate with distinct repression complexes to control gene transcription.  Nanog and Oct4 associate with unique repressor complexes on their target genes to control ES cell fate.  he main finding of this study is that knockdown of Trp53 and Pten independently resulted in significantly higher expression levels of the pluripotency-associated gene Nanog, and we hypothesize that TRP53 and PTEN mediated repression is important for the insulation of male germ cells from pluripotency.  The homeodomain transcription factor NANOG plays a central role in maintaining hESC pluripotency The newly derived NANOG reporter hESC lines present novel tools to visualize NANOG expression in viable hESCs.   Loss of Pten causes tumor initiation following differentiation of murine pluripotent stem cells due to failed repression of Nanog.  Furthermore, our data show that the mechanism by which Pten null ECCs emerge in vitro and cause tumors in vivo is through increased survival and self-renewal, due to failed repression of the transcription factor Nanog.  We report here that Nanog and Oct4 are reexpressed in two mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) lines following exposure to the differentiating agent DETA/NO.  Furthermore, Nanog binding to the promoter of Brachyury leads to repression of this gene, thus disrupting mesendoderm transition.  Maintaining pluripotency and indefinite self-renewal of embryonic stem cells requires a tight control of the expression of several key stemness factors, particularly Nanog and Oct4 transcription factors.  Current evidence suggests that ES cells maintain their pluripotent state by expressing a battery of transcription factors including Oct4 and Nanog.  Embryonic stem (ES) cell pluripotency is dependent upon sustained expression of the key transcriptional regulators Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2.  The expression of Oct4 is activated by FoxD3 and Nanog but repressed by Oct4 itself, thus, exerting an important negative feedback loop to limit its own activity.  Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 form the core of a transcription factor network that maintains embryonic stem cells in the pluripotent state in both humans and mice.  w that Bmi1 is enriched in the extraembryonic (endoderm [XEN] and trophectodermal stem [TS]) compartment and repressed by Nanog in pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells.  In vivo, Bm Nanog is a newly identified transcriptional factor bearing a homeodomain and expressed in pluripotential cells of preimplantation and early postimplantation embryos, and embryonic stem (ES) and embryonic germ (EG) cells.  Knockout experiments indicate that Nanog functions as a key player in maintaining the pluripotency of stem cells.  Thus, in germ cell development, NANOG is expressed in proliferating germ cells, in which nuclear reprogramming is progressing.  Nanog maintains pluripotency of mouse embryonic stem cells by inhibiting NFkappaB and cooperating with Stat3.  We performed a genome-wide screen that combined full-length mESC transcriptome genomic mapping data with chromatin immunoprecipitation genomic location maps of the key mESC transcription factors Oct4 and Nanog.  Nanog safeguards pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs).  Notably, the expression of Nanog, a key pluripotency regulator and repressor of extraembryonic endoderm specification in ES cells, was significantly reduced in Zic3 knockdown cells.

"[SOC]###context: Corynebacterium ulcerans is a zoonotic pathogen that can produce diphtheria toxin and causes an illness categorized as diphtheria in the European Union because its clinical appearance is similar to that of diphtheria caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae.   The zoonotic bacterium Corynebacterium ulcerans may be pathogenic both in humans and animals: toxigenic strains can cause diphtheria or diphtheria-like disease in humans via diphtheria toxin, while strains producing the dermonecrotic exotoxin phospholipase D may lead to caseous lymphadenitis primarily in wild animals.  Diphtheria toxin-positive Corynebacterium ulcerans strains have been isolated mainly from cattle, dogs and cats.  Corynebacterium diphtheriae, a pathogenic bacterium that causes diphtheria, has been performed.   Corynebacterium ulcerans 0102 carries the gene encoding diphtheria toxin on a prophage different from the C.  diphtheriae NCTC 13129 prophage.  Corynebacterium ulcerans can cause a diphtheria-like illness, especially when the bacterium is lysogenized with a tox gene-carrying bacteriophage that produces diphtheria toxin.  Acquisition of toxigenicity upon phage lysogenization is a common feature of C.  ulcerans and C.  diphtheriae.   Corynebacterium ulcerans (toxigenic C.  ulcerans) produces the diphtheria toxin, which causes pharyngeal and cutaneous diphtheria-like disease in people, and this bacterium is commonly detected in dogs and cats that are reared at home.   This case demonstrates that strains of C.  ulcerans that produce diphtheria toxin can cause infections of the skin that completely mimic typical cutaneous diphtheria, thereby potentially providing a source of bacteria capable of causing life-threatening diseases in the patient's environment.  Diphtheria is a serious upper respiratory tract disease caused by the diphtheria toxin (DT) secreted from the bacteria Corynebacterium diphtheriae.  ulcerans produce diphtheria toxin, which can cause life-threatening cardiopathies and neuropathies in humans.  A high-density growth approach was utilized to produce mutated diphtheria toxin from two strains of Corynebacterium diphtheria: C7 (beta)(tox-201,tox-9) and C7 (beta)(tox-107).  For the primary prevention of disease caused by diphtheria toxin-producing corynebacteria, vaccination with diphtheria toxoid is recommended.  ulcerans that produce diphtheria toxin can cause infections of the skin that completely mimic typical cutaneous diphtheria, thereby potentially providing a source of bacteria capable of causing life-threatening diseases in the patient's environment.

A possible biological mechanism for a diphtheria effect on hearing ability exists: The toxin produced by the Corynebacterium diphtheriae bacteria can cause damage to cranial nerves and therefore may affect the auditory neural pathway.  In cases of human infection with potentially toxigenic corynebacteria, it is important to determine the species and examine the isolate for diphtheria toxin production.  AIM: Study of the apoptogenic effect of Corynebacterium diphtheriae toxigenic strains on mice peritoneal macrophages in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Evaluation ofapoptosis induced by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes strains was performed by characteristic morphological changes in macrophages in smears stained by azure eosin by Romanovsky-Giemsa. RESULTS: Apoptogenic activity of diphtheria infectious agent was established to be determined by diphtheria exotoxin at early (after 1 hour) and surface structures and pathogenicity enzymes at later (3 hours) stages of effect. CONCLUSION: The ability of diphtheria infectious agent to cause macrophage apoptosis is one of the mechanisms of realization of its pathogenic properties determined by the effect of diphtheria exotoxin, as well as its surface structures and pathogenicity enzymes.  Extrapharyngeal infections caused by Corynebacterium ulcerans have rarely been reported previously, and diphtheria toxin production has usually not been addressed.  Corynebacterium ulcerans may cause diphtheria in humans and caseous lymphadenitis in animals.  ulcerans for the first time, we show that related sequence types (STs) might be associated with the presence of the diphtheria toxin gene, which encodes diphtheria toxin (DT), the most important diphtheria-causing virulence factor.

"[SOC]###context: The results showed that higher levels of TSH within the reference range were independently associated with the presence of CAD only among subjects less than or equal to 65 years old, suggesting age might influence the relationship.  FT3 levels within the normal range were inversely correlated with the presence and severity of CAD.  Moreover, lower FT3 concentrations were correlated with the Gensini score and independently predicted the presence and severity of CAD.  High TSH within the reference range was associated with increased risk of coronary death in women (P(trend) 0·005), but not in men.  The risk of coronary death was also increased among women with subclinical hypothyroidism or subclinical hyperthyroidism, compared to women with TSH of 0·50-1·4 mU/l.    Prevalence of CHD was more common in hypothyroid and moderate SCH patients.  The angiographic results were as follows: significant coronary disease (SH 28. 1% vs.  non-SH 43. 8%; p=0. 087); three-vessel disease (9. 4% vs.  9. 9%; p=0. 919); two-vessel disease (12. 5% vs.  13. 4%; p=0. 892); single-vessel disease (6. 3% vs.  29. 5%; p=0. 051); minimal lesions (9. 4% vs.  10. 9%; p=0. 794); and no coronary disease (62. 4% vs, 45. 3%; p=0. 064).  Lower fT3 levels were predictive of both single-vessel (p = 0. 012) and multivessel (p = 0. 009) CAD.  Through a multivariate logistic regression analysis, fT3 was still linked to the presence of CAD (hazard ratio [HR]: 0. 48, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0. 34-0. 68, p < 0. 001).  Our study showed that FT(4) levels were associated with the presence and the severity of CAD.  Also, this study suggests that elevated serum FT(4) levels even within normal range could be a risk factor for CAD.   The present meta-analysis indicates that sub-clinical hypothyroidism is associated with both, a significant risk of CHD at baseline and at follow-up.  The incidence of multi-vessel disease was higher in patients with high TSH level (p=0. 026).  TSH level showed a significant correlation with age (r=0. 109, p=0. 044) and Gensini's score (r=0. 117, p=0. 045).

"[SOC]###context: Ranolazine and lidocaine (10 μM) similarly reduced Ca2+i overload and improved left ventricle work recovery in whole-heart models of IR injury or exposure to ouabain (80 μM).  Ranolazine (10 μM), but not lidocaine (10 μM), reduced RM NCX1. 1-mediated Ca2+i overload in ventricular myocytes.  Blockade of the late inward sodium current, late I(Na), offers another target for the treatment of ischemia.  Blockade of late I(Na) reduces the sodium and calcium overload that follows ischemia.  Ranolazine, a late I(Na) inhibitor, has been shown to provide both anti-anginal and anti-ischemic benefits without significant alterations in the heart rate and blood pressure in patients with stable coronary artery disease.  Ranolazine is a new antianginal drug that reduces intracellular sodium and calcium accumulation during ischemia, thus potentially limiting myocardial ischemia.  Detergent extracted fiber bundles from DOCA-salt hearts demonstrated increased myofilament response to Ca(2+) with glutathionylation of myosin binding protein C.  Treatment with ranolazine ameliorated the Ca(2+) response and cross-bridge kinetics.  Ran reduces P(o) of RyR2, desensitizes Ca(2+)-dependent RyR2 activation, and inhibits Ca(i) oscillations, Ranolazine may provide functional protection of the heart during IR injury by reducing cCa2+ and mCa2+ loading secondary to its effect to block the late Na+ current.  Ranolazine is a novel antianginal medication that acts by ameliorating disturbed sodium and calcium homeostasis.  By preventing myocyte sodium and calcium overload, ranolazine also have potential beneficial effects on myocardial function.  Reduction by RAN of I(Na,L)-induced dysregulation of calcium cycling could contribute to the antiarrhythmic actions of this agent in both reentrant and triggered arrhythmias.  Moreover, in rabbit myocytes the increases in late I(Na), [Na(+)](i) and [Ca(2+)](i) caused by ATX-II, were significantly blunted by ranolazine.  These results suggest that ranolazine may be of therapeutic benefit in conditions of diastolic dysfunction due to elevated [Na(+)](i) and diastolic [Ca(2+)](i).  Ranolazine is a selective inhibitor of the late sodium current relative to peak sodium channel current, and via this mechanism, it may decrease sodium-dependent intracellular calcium overload during ischemia and reperfusion.  he beneficial effects of ranolazine in reducing Ca2+ overload and LV mechanical dysfunction during ischemia/reperfusion is consistent with the inhibition of late INa mechanism of action.  Ranolazine is a novel agent that inhibits the late sodium current thereby reducing cellular sodium and calcium overload Ranolazine selectively inhibits late I(Na), reduces [Na(+)](i)-dependent calcium overload and attenuates the abnormalities of ventricular repolarisation and contractility that are associated with ischaemia/reperfusion and heart failure.  The results indicate that ranolazine, at concentrations which have significantly beneficial effects during ischaemic episodes, only greatly affects whole cell calcium current when facilitated by beta-adrenoceptor or histamine receptor activation.  Ranolazine had only a small effect on the basal calcium current

"[SOC]###context: Here, we publish a frequency profile of the three ChromHMM promoter states, at 200-bp intervals, with particular reference to the existence of sequence patterns of promoter elements, GC-richness, and transcription starting sites.   ChromHMM learns chromatin-state signatures using a multivariate hidden Markov model (HMM) that explicitly models the combinatorial presence or absence of each mark.  ChromHMM uses these signatures to generate a genome-wide annotation for each cell type by calculating the most probable state for each genomic segment ChromHMM provides an automated enrichment analysis of the resulting annotations to facilitate the functional interpretations of each chromatin state.  ChromHMM is distinguished by its modeling emphasis on combinations of marks, its tight integration with downstream functional enrichment analyses, its speed, and its ease of use.  Chromatin states are learned, annotations are produced, and enrichments are computed within 1 d.  ChromHMM helps to annotate the noncoding genome using epigenomic information across one or multiple cell types.  It combines multiple genome-wide epigenomic maps, and uses combinatorial and spatial mark patterns to infer a complete annotation for each cell type Our aim was to identify the possible relationship between DNA sequences and the newly built chromatin states based on the integrated ChromHMM datasets of different cells and tissue types.  Here, we publish a frequency profile of the three ChromHMM promoter states, at 200-bp intervals, with particular reference to the existence of sequence patterns of promoter elements, GC-richness, and transcription starting sites.  Building the Frequency Profile of the Core Promoter Element Patterns in the Three ChromHMM Promoter States at 200bp Intervals: A Statistical Perspective.  Based on the ChromHMM algorithm, the genome was divided into 620,122 fragments, which were classified into 24 states according to the combination of epigenetic marks and enriched-feature regions.  The nucleotide frequency profiles of nine chromatin annotations with the units of 200 bp were analyzed and integrative Markov chains were built to detect the Markov properties of the DNA sequences in some of the active chromatin states of different ChromHMM regions.  We analyzed the publicly available ChromHMM BED files of the ENCODE project and tested the Markov properties of the different chromatin states in the human genome.  In addition, we comprehensively compare our method to ChromHMM on three real datasets and show that our method estimates more chromatin states than ChromHMM for those datasets.  RESULTS: In this paper, we propose a linear time algorithm for calculating a set of non-overlapping regions that maximizes the sum of similarities between the vector of focal epigenetic states and the vectors of raw epigenetic states at DNA positions in the set of regions.  Nucleotide frequency profiles of regional chromatin segmentations were analyzed, and Markov chains were built to detect Markov properties in the chromatin states of different ChromHMM regions.  RESULTS: In this study, we propose a method to estimate the chromatin states indicated by genome-wide chromatin marks identified by NGS technologies.  The proposed method automatically estimates the number of chromatin states and characterize each state on the basis of a hidden Markov model (HMM) in combination with a recently proposed model selection technique, factorized information criteria.  Chromatin states are learned, annotations are produced, and enrichments are computed within 1 d.

"[SOC]###context: De Novo SOX6 Variants Cause a Neurodevelopmental Syndrome Associated with ADHD, Craniosynostosis, and Osteochondromas.  For SOX6, these processes include, but are not limited to, neurogenesis and skeletogenesis.  Variants in half of the SOX genes have been shown to cause severe developmental and adult syndromes, referred to as SOXopathies.  We here provide evidence that SOX6 variants also cause a SOXopathy.  Using clinical and genetic data, we identify 19 individuals harboring various types of SOX6 alterations and exhibiting developmental delay and/or intellectual disability; the individuals are from 17 unrelated families.  Additional, inconstant features include attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, mild facial dysmorphism, craniosynostosis, and multiple osteochondromas.  All variants are heterozygous.  Fourteen are de novo, one is inherited from a mosaic father, and four offspring from two families have a paternally inherited variant.  Intragenic microdeletions, balanced structural rearrangements, frameshifts, and nonsense variants are predicted to inactivate the SOX6 variant allele.  Four missense variants occur in residues and protein regions highly conserved evolutionarily.  These variants are not detected in the gnomAD control cohort, and the amino acid substitutions are predicted to be damaging.  Two of these variants are located in the HMG domain and abolish SOX6 transcriptional activity in vitro.  No clear genotype-phenotype correlations are found.  Taken together, these findings concur that SOX6 haploinsufficiency leads to a neurodevelopmental SOXopathy that often includes ADHD and abnormal skeletal and other features.

"[SOC]###context:  Thus, nuclear ERK5 activates transcription factors by either direct phosphorylation or acting as co-activator thanks to a unique transcriptional activation TAD domain located at its C-terminal tail.   Although lacking kinase activity, these forms activate transcription by interacting with transcription factors through the TAD domain.   Myc has an N-terminal transcription activation domain (TAD) that interacts with various coactivators and a C-terminal basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHZip) domain required for E box-specific DNA-binding and heterodimerization with its obligatory bHLHZip protein partner Max.   p300 worked synergistically with MRTF-A to activate the transcription of MYH9, MYL9 and CYR61.  As identified by co-IP, p300 interacted with the C-terminal TAD domain of MRTF-A.  To investigate further the role of cytoplasmic sequestration of p53 in its inhibition by the E1B 55-kDa protein we systematically examined domains in both the Ad12 55-kDa protein and p53 that underpin their colocalization in the cytoplasmic body and show that the N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) of p53 is essential for retaining p53 in the cytoplasmic body.  Physical interaction between the transactivation domain (TAD) of the mixed-lineage leukemia protein (MLL) and the KIX domain of the cyclic-AMP response element binding protein (CREB) binding protein (CBP) is necessary for MLL-mediated transcriptional activation.

"[SOC]###context: We identify large, megabase-sized local chromatin interaction domains, which we term 'topological domains', as a pervasive structural feature of the genome organization.  The domains are stable across different cell types and highly conserved across species, indicating that topological domains are an inherent property of mammalian genomes Insulators are involved in 3D genome organization at multiple spatial scales and are important for dynamic reorganization of chromatin structure during reprogramming and differentiation.  The relation between alterations in chromatin structure and changes in gene expression during cell differentiation has served as a paradigm to understand the link between genome organization and function.  Architectural proteins orchestrate higher-order chromatin organization through the establishment of interactions between regulatory elements across multiple spatial scales.  The regulation of these proteins, their interaction with DNA, and their co-occurrence in the genome, may be responsible for the plasticity of 3D chromatin architecture that dictates cell and time-specific blueprints of gene expression.  The role of 3D genome organisation in the control and execution of lineage-specific transcription programmes during the development and differentiation of multipotent stem cells into specialised cell types remains poorly understood.  Chromatin structural states and their remodelling, including higher-order chromatin folding and three-dimensional (3D) genome organisation, play an important role in the control of gene expression Here, we show that substantial remodelling of the higher-order chromatin structure of the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC), a keratinocyte lineage-specific gene locus on mouse chromosome 3, occurs during epidermal morphogenesis.  Many studies have suggested a link between the spatial organization of genomes and fundamental biological processes such as genome reprogramming, gene expression, and differentiation.  Moreover, we reveal that formation of such highly condensed, transcriptionally repressed heterochromatin promotes transcriptional activation of differentiation genes and loss of pluripotency.  The open chromatin of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) condenses into repressive heterochromatin as cells exit the pluripotent state.  we find that localized heterochromatin condensation of ribosomal RNA genes initiates establishment of highly condensed chromatin structures outside of the nucleolus We focus on the emerging relationship between genome organization and lineage-specific transcriptional regulation, which we argue are inextricably linked.  Cells face the challenge of storing two meters of DNA in the three-dimensional (3D) space of the nucleus that spans only a few microns.  The nuclear organization that is required to overcome this challenge must allow for the accessibility of the gene regulatory machinery to the DNA and, in the case of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), for the transcriptional and epigenetic changes that accompany differentiation In this review we summarize some of the recent findings illuminating the 3D structure of the eukaryotic genome, as well as the relationship between genome topology and function from the level of whole chromosomes to enhancer-promoter loops with a focus on features affecting genome organization in ESCs and changes in nuclear organization during differentiation We observe that although self-associating chromatin domains are stable during differentiation, chromatin interactions both within and between domains change in a striking manner, altering 36% of active and inactive chromosomal compartments throughout the genome

"[SOC]###context: The single genomic locus, AbetaH-J-J, encodes three functionally distinct proteins aspartyl beta-hydroxylase, junctin and junctate by alternative splicing.  The human AbetaH-J-J locus is a genomic sequence which generates three functionally distinct proteins, the enzyme aspartyl-beta-hydroxylase (AbetaH), the structural protein of sarcoplasmic reticulum junctin, and the membrane-bound calcium binding protein junctate.  Aspartyl (asparaginyl)-beta-hydroxylase (AAH) hydroxylates Asp and Asn residues within EGF-like domains of Notch and Jagged, which mediate cell motility and differentiation.  This study examines the expression, regulation and function of AAH, and its related transcripts, Humbug and Junctin, which lack catalytic domains, using SH-Sy5y neuroblastoma cells.  Alternative splicing of the locus AbetaH-J-J generates three functionally distinct proteins: an enzyme, AbetaH (aspartyl-beta-hydroxylase), a structural protein of the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane (junctin), and an integral membrane calcium binding protein (junctate).  Junctate is a newly identified integral ER/SR membrane calcium binding protein, which is an alternative splicing form of the same gene generating aspartyl beta-hydroxylase and junctin.  Screening a mouse heart cDNA library using canine junctin cDNA as a probe yielded three complete mouse heart cDNAs.  One of the cDNAs is homologous to the previously reported human junctate.  Screening a cDNA library from human skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle with a cDNA probe derived from junctin led to the isolation of two groups of cDNA clones.  The first group displayed a deduced amino acid sequence that is 84% identical to that of dog heart junctin, whereas the second group had a single open reading frame that encoded a polypeptide with a predicted mass of 33 kDa, whose first 78 NH(2)-terminal residues are identical to junctin whereas its COOH terminus domain is identical to aspartyl beta-hydroxylase, a member of the alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family.  We named the latter amino acid sequence junctate.  Our study shows that alternative splicing of the same gene generates the following functionally distinct proteins: an enzyme (aspartyl beta-hydroxylase), a structural protein of SR (junctin), and a membrane-bound calcium binding protein (junctate).  Junctin is a calsequestrin binding protein detected in junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum of striated muscles.  In the present study, the human cardiac junctin cDNA has been cloned by human heart cDNA library screening and RT-PCR, and the cDNA sequence has been determined.  The deduced amino acid sequence of human junctin (210 aa) has 84% sequence identity to that of canine junctin identified previously.  A human junctin isoform (isoform 1, 225 aa) was also identified and characterized.  The isoform 1 has a 15 aa insertion at the amino acid residue 55 of the human junctin.  Northern blot analysis revealed that the human junctin was present both in cardiac and skeletal muscles, and the sizes of the transcripts were approximately 3. 0 and 4. 2kb.  Amino acid residues 6-78 of human junctin and 35-107 of human aspartyl beta-hydroxylase (hAspH) overlapped perfectly.  The mouse aspartyl beta-hydroxylase gene (Asph, BAH) has been cloned and characterized.  The mouse BAH gene spans 200 kilobase pairs of genomic DNA and contains 24 exons.  Of three major BAH-related transcripts, the two largest (6,629 and 4,419 base pairs) encode full-length protein and differ only in the use of alternative polyadenylation signals.  The smallest BAH-related transcript (2,789 base pairs) uses an alternative 3' terminal exon, resulting in a protein lacking a catalytic domain.

Since the discovery that many transcriptional enhancers are transcribed into long noncoding RNAs termed ""enhancer RNAs"" (eRNAs), their putative role in enhancer function has been debated.  Recent studies have revealed that active enhancers are transcribed, producing a class of noncoding RNAs called enhancer RNAs (eRNAs).  Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) are a class of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) expressed from active enhancers, whose function and action mechanism are yet to be firmly established.

In addition to widespread transcription of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in mammalian cells, bidirectional ncRNAs are transcribed on enhancers, and are thus referred to as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs).   A subset of enhancers are occupied by RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) and transcribed to produce long non-coding RNAs termed eRNAs.   Very recent evidence has indicted that some eRNAs play a role in initiating or activating transcription, possibly by helping recruit and/or stabilize binding of the general transcription machinery to the proximal promoter of their target genes.   In addition to widespread transcription of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in mammalian cells, bidirectional ncRNAs are transcribed on enhancers, and are thus referred to as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs).  However, it has remained unclear whether these eRNAs are functional or merely a reflection of enhancer activation.   Notably, RNAPII at enhancers transcribes bi-directionally a novel class of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) within enhancer domains defined by the presence of histone H3 monomethylated at lysine 4.  The level of eRNA expression at neuronal enhancers positively correlates with the level of messenger RNA synthesis at nearby genes, suggesting that eRNA synthesis occurs specifically at enhancers that are actively engaged in promoting mRNA synthesis.  A function of CBP at enhancers may be to recruit RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), as we also observed activity-regulated RNAPII binding to thousands of enhancers.  Notably, RNAPII at enhancers transcribes bi-directionally a novel class of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) within enhancer domains defined by the presence of histone H3 monomethylated at lysine 4.

Dilemmas concerning dose distribution and the influence of relative biological effect in proton beam therapy of medulloblastoma.  OBJECTIVE: To improve medulloblastoma proton therapy.  The aim of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of proton beam therapy with cochlear dose reduction compared with conventional X-ray radiotherapy for medulloblastoma in childhood.  The aim of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of proton beam therapy with cochlear dose reduction compared with conventional X-ray radiotherapy for medulloblastoma in childhood. We developed a Markov model to describe health states of 6-year-old children with medulloblastoma after treatment with proton or X-ray radiotherapy All patients completed therapy without interruption. Our proton-beam technique for craniospinal irradiation of pediatric medulloblastoma has successfully reduced normal-tissue doses and acute treatment-related sequelae Potential role of proton therapy in the treatment of pediatric medulloblastoma/primitive neuro-ectodermal tumors: spinal theca irradiation For 6 MV x-rays > 60% of the dose prescribed to the target was delivered to 44% of the heart volume, while the proton beam was able to completely avoid the heart, the liver, and in all likelihood the thyroid and gonads as well. The present study demonstrates a potential role of proton therapy in decreasing the dose (and toxicity) to the critical structures in the irradiation of the spinal neuraxis in medulloblastoma/PNET Potential role of proton therapy in the treatment of pediatric medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumors: reduction of the supratentorial target volume This review describes the role of radiation in general and proton therapy in particular for the treatment of medulloblastoma, central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumors, atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors, and the recently described embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes Reducing toxicity from craniospinal irradiation: using proton beams to treat medulloblastoma in young children.  Intensity-modulated radiotherapy did show more bladder dose reduction than the other techniques in pelvic sarcoma irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: In the diseases studied, using various techniques of 3D-CRT, electrons, IMRT, and protons, protons are most optimal in treating retinoblastomas, medulloblastomas (posterior fossa and craniospinal), and pelvic sarcomas.  For 6 MV x-rays>60% of the dose prescribed to the target was delivered to 44% of the heart volume, while the proton beam was able to completely avoid the heart, the liver, and in all likelihood the thyroid and gonads as well. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates a potential role of proton therapy in decreasing the dose (and toxicity) to the critical structures in the irradiation of the spinal neuraxis in medulloblastoma/PNET.

"[SOC]###context: DDX54 regulates transcriptome dynamics during DNA damage response.  The contribution of post-transcriptional gene regulatory networks to the DNA damage response (DDR) has not been extensively studied.  Here, we systematically identified RNA-binding proteins differentially interacting with polyadenylated transcripts upon exposure of human breast carcinoma cells to ionizing radiation (IR).  Interestingly, more than 260 proteins, including many nucleolar proteins, showed increased binding to poly(A)+RNA in IR-exposed cells.  The functional analysis of DDX54, a candidate genotoxic stress responsive RNA helicase, revealed that this protein is an immediate-to-early DDR regulator required for the splicing efficacy of its target IR-induced pre-mRNAs.  Upon IR exposure, DDX54 acts by increased interaction with a well-defined class of pre-mRNAs that harbor introns with weak acceptor splice sites, as well as by protein-protein contacts within components of U2 snRNP and spliceosomal B complex, resulting in lower intron retention and higher processing rates of its target transcripts.  Because DDX54 promotes survival after exposure to IR, its expression and/or mutation rate may impact DDR-related pathologies.  Our work indicates the relevance of many uncharacterized RBPs potentially involved in the DDR.  The functional analysis of DDX54, a candidate genotoxic stress responsive RNA helicase, revealed that this protein is an immediate-to-early DDR regulator required for the splicing efficacy of its target IR-induced pre-mRNAs.

"[SOC]###context: We discovered the most differentiated variants between TBN and HAN at chromosome 1q42. 2 and 2p21.  EGLN1 (or HIFPH2, MIM 606425) and EPAS1 (or HIF2A, MIM 603349), both related to hypoxia-inducible factor, were found most differentiated in the two regions, respectively.  All of our population genomic and statistical analyses indicate that EPAS1 and EGLN1 are most likely responsible for HAA of Tibetans.  Recent studies have identified genes involved in high-altitude adaptation in Tibetans.  Genetic variants/haplotypes within regions containing three of these genes (EPAS1, EGLN1, and PPARA) are associated with relatively decreased hemoglobin levels observed in Tibetans at high altitude, providing corroborative evidence for genetic adaptation to this extreme environment.   In combination with the reported data, we identified strong signals of selective sweep in two hypoxia-related genes, EPAS1 and EGLN1.   Three of these genes, EPAS1, EGLN1 and PPARA, regulate or are regulated by hypoxia inducible factor, a principal controller of erythropoiesis and other organismal functions.  Identification of a Tibetan-specific mutation in the hypoxic gene EGLN1 and its contribution to high-altitude adaptation.  Here we conducted resequencing of the entire genomic region (59. 4 kb) of the hypoxic gene EGLN1 (one of the top candidates from the genome-wide scans) in Tibetans and identified 185 sequence variations, including 13 novel variations (12 substitutions and 1 insertion or deletion).  The estimated selective intensity (0. 029 for the C allele of rs186996510) puts EGLN1 among the known genes that have undergone the strongest selection in human populations, and the onset of selection was estimated to have started at the early Neolithic (∼8,400 years ago).   Two functional loci in the promoter of EPAS1 gene involved in high-altitude adaptation of Tibetans.  EPAS1 involves in the hypoxic response and is suggested to be responsible for the genetic adaptation of high-altitude hypoxia in Tibetans.  Three of these genes (EPAS1, EGLN1 and PPARA) are associated with decreased haemoglobin levels compared with non-Tibetans living at altitude.   HMOX2 Functions as a Modifier Gene for High-Altitude Adaptation in Tibetans.  In this study, we report a downstream gene (HMOX2) involved in heme catabolism, which harbors potentially adaptive variants in Tibetans.   Collectively, we propose that HMOX2 contributes to high-altitude adaptation in Tibetans by functioning as a modifier in the regulation of hemoglobin metabolism.  Positively selected haplotypes of EGLN1 and PPARA were significantly associated with the decreased hemoglobin phenotype that is unique to this highland population.   Studies of Tibetans revealed candidates for high-altitude adaptations in the EGLN1 and EPAS1 genes, associated with lower haemoglobin concentration.  Here we analyse genotype data for the Nepalese Sherpa, and find that Tibetans are a mixture of ancestral populations related to the Sherpa and Han Chinese.  EGLN1 and EPAS1 genes show a striking enrichment of high-altitude ancestry in the Tibetan genome, indicating that migrants from low altitude acquired adaptive alleles from the highlanders.  Genetic variants/haplotypes within regions containing three of these genes (EPAS1, EGLN1, and PPARA) are associated with relatively decreased hemoglobin levels observed in Tibetans at high altitude, providing corroborative evidence for genetic adaptation to this extreme environment.  All of the population genomic and statistical analysis indicated that EPAS1 and EGLN1 are mostly likely responsible for high altitude adaptation and closely related to low Hb concentration in Tibetans.  Interestingly, one gene previously known to be important in cellular oxygen sensing, EGLN1 (also known as PHD2), shows evidence of positive selection in both Tibetans and Andeans.  (or HIFPH2, MIM 606425) and EPAS1 (or HIF2A, MIM 603349), both related to hypoxia-inducible factor, were found most differentiated in the two regions, respectively.  It demonstrated that the C allele of rs56721780:G C decreased the binding of IKZF1, leading to the attenuated transcriptional repression of EPAS1 gene.

The Tibetan-specific 200 kb EPAS1 haplotype introgressed from an archaic human population related to Denisovans which underwent evolutionary decay; however, the functional variant(s) responsible for high-altitude adaptation at EPAS1/HIF-2α have not yet been identified.

"[SOC]###context: Regulatory sites for splicing in human basal ganglia are enriched for disease-relevant information.  Genome-wide association studies have generated an increasing number of common genetic variants associated with neurological and psychiatric disease risk.  An improved understanding of the genetic control of gene expression in human brain is vital considering this is the likely modus operandum for many causal variants.  However, human brain sampling complexities limit the explanatory power of brain-related expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and allele-specific expression (ASE) signals.  We address this, using paired genomic and transcriptomic data from putamen and substantia nigra from 117 human brains, interrogating regulation at different RNA processing stages and uncovering novel transcripts.  We identify disease-relevant regulatory loci, find that splicing eQTLs are enriched for regulatory information of neuron-specific genes, that ASEs provide cell-specific regulatory information with evidence for cellular specificity, and that incomplete annotation of the brain transcriptome limits interpretation of risk loci for neuropsychiatric disease.

"[SOC]###context: The human sex chromosomes differ in sequence, except for the pseudoautosomal regions (PAR) at the terminus of the short and the long arms, denoted as PAR1 and PAR2.  The boundary between PAR1 and the unique X and Y sequences was established during the divergence of the great apes.   The insertion is generated by non-allelic homologous recombination between a 548 bp LTR6B repeat within the Y chromosome PAR1 and a second LTR6B repeat located 105 kb from the PAR boundary on the X chromosome.   The pseudoautosomal regions (PAR1 and PAR2) of the human X and Y chromosomes pair and recombine during meiosis.  Thus genes in this region are not inherited in a strictly sex-linked fashion.  PAR1 is located at the terminal region of the short arms and PAR2 at the tips of the long arms of these chromosomes.  To date, 24 genes have been assigned to the PAR1 region.  In contrast, so far only 4 genes have been discovered in the PAR2 region.  The 320-kb human pseudoautosomal region 2 (PAR2) at the tips of the long arms of the X and Y chromosomes is thought to have been duplicated onto the Y chromosome recently in primate evolution  The four genes within PAR2 have been proposed to constitute two zones with different base ratios and transcription, one of which was added recently to the X chromosome.

Herein, we investigated the regulation of STAT3 activation and the therapeutic effects of Icaritin, a prenyl flavonoid derivative from Epimedium Genus, in renal cell carcinoma (RCC).    Overall, these results suggest that Icaritin strongly inhibits STAT3 activation and is a potentially effective therapeutic option for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma we have reviewed important signaling pathways that are closely related to radiosensitization, such as cell cycle arrest, tumor angiogenesis, JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway and Mismatch repair Interleukin-27 signaling is mediated by the JAK-STAT pathway via activation of STAT1 and STAT3, which have tumor suppressive and oncogenic activities, respectively.  Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis are key processes in carcinogenesis.  The inhibition of STAT3 activation had no effect on the development of the epithelial phenotype.  STAT3 plays a vital role in inducing and maintaining a pro-carcinogenic inflammatory microenvironment and is reported to be a critical mediator of the oncogenic effects of EGFR mutations.  STAT3 activation is mediated through JAK family kinases  EESB treatment could significantly suppress the activation of several CRC-related pathways, including STAT3, Erk, and p38 signalings in tumor tissues, and alter the expression of multiple critical target genes such as Bcl-2, Bax, Cyclin D1, CDK4, and p21.  These molecular effects lead to the induction of cancer cell apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation.  Our findings demonstrate that SB possesses a broad range of antitumor activities because of its ability to affect multiple intracellular targets Western immunoblotting analyses of mouse lung tissues indicated significantly lower level of pSTAT3 and Mcl-1 in the carcinogen plus DMAPT group relative to the group treated with the carcinogen only.

The protective effect of repeated exposure to the ameliorating hormonal and immunological changes of pregnancy may counterbalance the effect of early exposure to the postpartum reversal of these changes.  We found an inverse correlation between the number of pregnancies and age at onset of RA A larger number of pregnancies and late menopause show a protective effect, delaying the onset of the disease.  Since the landmark study on rheumatoid arthritis, many reports have suggested that physiological changes during pregnancy often induce remission of systemic and cutaneous inflammatory diseases.  Literature review shows that at best, there are weak negative associations between current estrogen use and RA, and no association with nulliparity and infertility.  It appears that infertility, the number of pregnancies, and pregnancy outcome are not strongly associated with the risk of developing RA in women of childbearing age.  However, in this study there may have been selection biases in the women with RA and the controls that differentially could have affected their reproductive outcomes.

The C-HPP aims to foster the development of proteome analysis and integration of the findings from related molecular -omics technology platforms through collaborations among universities, industries, and private research groups.  The goal of the Human Proteome Project (HPP) is to fully characterize the 21,000 human protein-coding genes with respect to the estimated two million proteins they encode.  As such, the HPP aims to create a comprehensive, detailed resource to help elucidate protein functions and to advance medical treatment.  The Chromosome-centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP) aims to define all proteins encoded in each chromosome and especially to identify proteins that currently lack evidence by mass spectrometry.  Our results will contribute to the accomplishment of the primary goal of the C-HPP in identifying so-called ""missing proteins"" and generating a whole protein catalog for each chromosome.  there is only little information relative to their abundance, distribution, subcellular localization, interactions, or cellular functions.  The aim of the HUPO Human Proteome Project (HPP, www. thehpp. org ) is to collect this information for every human protein.  .  To support the efforts of the Chromosome-centric Human Proteome Project Consortium, we have annotated these proteins with their respective chromosome location.  One of the major challenges of a chromosome-centric proteome project is to explore in a systematic manner the potential proteins identified from the chromosomal genome sequence, but not yet characterized on a protein level.  The Chromosome 16 Consortium forms part of the Human Proteome Project that aims to develop an entire map of the proteins encoded by the human genome following a chromosome-centric strategy (C-HPP) to make progress in the understanding of human biology in health and disease (B/D-HPP).  A first research development progress report of the Chromosome 19 Consortium with members from Sweden, Norway, Spain, United States, China and India, a part of the Chromosome-centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP) global initiative, is presented ( http://www. c-hpp. org ).  In an effort to map the human proteome, the Chromosome-centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP) was recently initiated.

"[SOC]###context: a new member of the Prevotellaceae family that was isolated from stool samples from a 45-year-old patient.  Using univariate non-parametric statistics, there were no differences regarding alpha or beta diversity between AH8. 1 carriers (categories I and II) and non-carriers (categories III and IV), however four different taxa (Prevotellaceae, Clostridium XVIII, Coprococcus, Enterorhabdus) had nominally significant lower abundances in AH8. 1 carriers than non-carriers.  The increase in Bacteroidetes was found to be due to an increase in members of the families Bacteroidaceae or Prevotellaceae.   Fecal communities clustered into previously described enterotypes distinguished primarily by levels of Bacteroides and Prevotella.  Although the distinction of enterotypes as either discrete clusters or a continuum will require additional investigation, numerous studies have demonstrated the co-exclusion of the closely related Prevotellaceae and Bacteroides genera in the gut microbiota of healthy human subjects where Prevotella appears to be a discriminatory taxon for residence in more agrarian societies Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Bacteroidaceae, Prevotellaceae, and Rickenellaceae were the predominant families detected in the active microbiota Specifically, Firmicutes were dominant in normal-weight and obese individuals but significantly decreased in post-gastric-bypass individuals, who had a proportional increase of Gammaproteobacteria.  Numbers of the H(2)-producing Prevotellaceae were highly enriched in the obese individuals.  A comparative sequence analysis revealed that these two species are members of the family 'Prevotellaceae' but are phylogenetically distant (<88% sequence similarity) from the known genera belonging to this family, including Prevotella, Hallela and Xylanibacter.

"[SOC]###context: Eliglustat compared with imiglucerase in patients with Gaucher's disease type 1 stabilised on enzyme replacement therapy: a phase 3, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial.  We investigated whether patients stable on such treatment would remain so after switching to oral eliglustat, a selective inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase.  Patients were randomly allocated 2:1 at 39 clinics (stratified by ERT dose; block sizes of four; computer-generated centrally) to receive either oral eliglustat or imiglucerase infusions for 12 months.   The non-inferiority margin was 25% for eliglustat relative to imiglucerase, assessed in all patients who completed 12 months of treatment.  NTERPRETATION: Oral eliglustat maintained haematological and organ volume stability in adults with Gaucher's disease type 1 already controlled by intravenous ERT and could be a useful therapeutic option.

"[SOC]###context: Dicer is a component of the protein machinery (the RNA Induced Silencing Complex [RISC]) which is involved in catalyzing the formation of mature microRNAs from their precursors in the process of microRNA biogenesis.  RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) Proteins PACT, TRBP, and Dicer are SRA binding nuclear receptor coregulators.  The cytoplasmic RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) contains dsRNA binding proteins, including protein kinase RNA activator (PACT), transactivation response RNA binding protein (TRBP), and Dicer, that process pre-microRNAs into mature microRNAs (miRNAs) that target specific mRNA species for regulation.    Although the major RNAi pathway proteins are found in most subcellular compartments, the miRNA- and siRNA-loaded Ago2 populations co-sediment almost exclusively with the rER membranes, together with the RISC loading complex (RLC) factors Dicer, TAR RNA binding protein (TRBP) and protein activator of the interferon-induced protein kinase (PACT).  RNA interference (RNAi) is mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are liberated from double-stranded (ds)RNA precursors by Dicer and guide the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to targets.  .  Dicer, an RNase III enzyme, plays a central role in the RNAi pathway by cleaving precursors of both of these classes of RNAs to form mature siRNAs and miRNAs, which are then loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC).   Canonical siRNAs are 21 nucleotides (nt) in length and are loaded to the RNA Induced Silencing Complex when introduced into the cells, while longer siRNA molecules are first processed by endogenous Dicer and thus termed Dicer-substrate siRNA (DsiRNA).

"[SOC]###context: Overall, we identified aberrant transcripts in 8% of the patients (familial cases 30%; early-onset manifestation 21%).  In eight of them, two different out-of-frame pseudoexons were found consisting of a 167-bp insertion from intron 4 in five families with a shared founder haplotype and a 83-bp insertion from intron 10 in three patients.  The pseudoexon formation was caused by three different heterozygous germline mutations, which are supposed to activate cryptic splice sites We apply OS-Seq to resequence the exons of either 10 or 344 cancer genes from human DNA samples.

In recursive partitioning, a specific gene variant profile including LGR5 rs17109924, CD44 rs8193, and ALDH1A1 rs1342024 represented a high-risk subgroup with a median TTR of 1. 7 years (HR, 6. 71, 95% CI: 2. 71-16. 63, P < 0. 001).  In this study, we identified common germline variants in VEGF-dependent and -independent angiogenesis genes predicting clinical outcome and tumor response in patients with mCRC receiving first-line bevacizumab and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy.  We identified 22 nonsynonymous somatic mutations of which the majority was of missense type.  In germline, three novel nonsynonymous variants were identified in the following genes: CSMD3, EPHB6 and C10orf137, and none of the variants were present in 890 population-matched healthy controls.  It is possible that the identified germline variants modulate predisposition to CRC.  One patient proved to carry an APC whole-gene deletion; 4 of 25 (16%) patients showed biallelic and 3 of 25 (12%) monoallelic MUTYH mutations.  In the three heterozygous subjects no pathogenetic variants were found in OGG1, MTH1, APE1, MSH2, and MSH6 genes.  Frequency assessment of MUTYH mutations in healthy subjects showed that only Y165C and G382D reach a subpolymorphic frequency.  Scrutinizing the molecular genetic results and family data of 242 index patients with pathogenic APC mutations led to the identification of 10 mosaic cases (4%).  C>T transitions were observed in CGA sites in four of the 10 cases with somatic mosaicism, which is significantly more than 26 of the 232 non-mosaic cases (p = 0. 02).  Phenotypes of patients with somatic mosaicism ranged from an attenuated form of polyposis coli to florid polyposis with major extracolonic manifestations.  Altogether 12 previously reported changes and four novel genetic alterations, mostly in intronic sequences, were identified.  The results revealed the presence of biallelic germline MYH mutations in two patients.  These patients were compound heterozygotes for two of the most common germline mutations c. 494 A>G (p.

Here, we present detailed protocols for live-cell imaging of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae telomerase RNA subunit, called TLC1, and also of the non-coding telomeric repeat-containing RNA TERRA Live-cell imaging of budding yeast telomerase RNA and TERRA We show here that TERRA RNA interacts with several telomere-associated proteins, including telomere repeat factors 1 (TRF1) and 2 (TRF2), subunits of the origin recognition complex (ORC), heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), histone H3 trimethyl K9 (H3 K9me3), and members of the DNA-damage-sensing pathway.  telomere repeat encoding rna referred to as terra has been identified as a potential component of yeast and mammalian telomeres we show here that terra rna interacts with several telomere associated proteins including telomere repeat factors 1 trf1 and 2 trf2 subunits of the origin recognition complex orc heterochromatin protein 1 hp1 histone h3 trimethyl k9 h3 k9me3 and members of the dna damage sensing pathway sirna depletion of terra caused an increase in telomere dysfunction induced foci aberrations in metaphase telomeres and a loss of histone h3 k9me3 and orc at telomere repeat dna previous studies found that trf2 amino terminal gar domain recruited orc to telomeres we now show that terra rna can interact directly with the trf2 gar and orc1 to form a stable ternary complex we conclude that terra facilitates trf2 interaction with orc and plays a central role in telomere structural maintenance and heterochromatin formation.  telomeres play crucial roles in the maintenance of genome integrity and control of cellular senescence most eukaryotic telomeres can be transcribed to generate a telomeric repeat containing rna terra that persists as a heterogeneous nuclear rna and can be developmentally regulated however the precise function and regulation of terra in normal and cancer cell development remains poorly understood here we show that terra accumulates in highly proliferating normal and cancer cells and forms large nuclear foci which are distinct from previously characterized markers of dna damage or replication stress using a mouse model for medulloblastoma driven by chronic sonic hedgehog shh signaling terra rna was detected in tumor but not adjacent normal cells using both rna fluorescence in situ hybridization fish and northern blotting rna fish revealed the formation of terra foci terfs in the nuclear regions of rapidly proliferating tumor cells in the normal developing cerebellum terra aggregates could also be detected in highly proliferating zones of progenitor neurons shh could enhance terra expression in purified granule progenitor cells in vitro suggesting that proliferation signals contribute to terra expression in responsive tissue terra foci did not colocalize with γh2ax foci promyelocytic leukemia pml or cajal bodies in mouse tumor tissue we also provide evidence that terra is elevated in a variety of human cancers these findings suggest that elevated terra levels reflect a novel early form of telomere regulation during replication stress and cancer cell evolution and the terra rna aggregates may form a novel nuclear body in highly proliferating mammalian cells.

"[SOC]###context: These effects of pridopidine may serve to strengthen the cortico-striatal communication and to improve motor control in Huntington's disease for which pridopidine is currently in development.  A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of pridopidine in Huntington's disease.  We examined the effects of 3 dosages of pridopidine, a dopamine-stabilizing compound, on motor function and other features of Huntington's disease, with additional evaluation of its safety and tolerability.   Although the primary analysis did not demonstrate a statistically significant treatment effect, the overall results suggest that pridopidine may improve motor function in Huntington's disease.   One-year safety and tolerability profile of pridopidine in patients with Huntington disease.  OBJECTIVE: To assess the 1-year safety profile of the dopaminergic stabilizer pridopidine in patients with Huntington disease.  CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class IV evidence that pridopidine (≤90 mg/day) is generally safe and well-tolerated in patients with Huntington disease for up to 1 year.  Pridopidine is being developed for the treatment of impaired motor function associated with Huntington's disease and belongs to a new class of compounds known as dopidines, which act as dopaminergic stabilizers.   There is so far neither cure nor approved disease-slowing therapy for HD, though recent clinical studies have shown a beneficial long-term effect of pridopidine in patients with HD.   Pridopidine for the treatment of motor function in patients with Huntington's disease (MermaiHD): a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.  Pridopidine belongs to a new class of compounds known as dopaminergic stabilisers, and results from a small phase 2 study in patients with Huntington's disease suggested that this drug might improve voluntary motor function.  We aimed to assess further the effects of pridopidine in patients with Huntington's disease.  METHODS: We undertook a 6 month, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy of pridopidine in the treatment of motor deficits in patients with Huntington's disease.  INTERPRETATION: This study did not provide evidence of efficacy as measured by the mMS, but a potential effect of pridopidine on the motor phenotype of Huntington's disease merits further investigation.  Pridopidine up to 90 mg per day was well tolerated in patients with Huntington's disease.   Regional cerebral glucose metabolism after pridopidine (ACR16) treatment in patients with Huntington disease.  Pridopidine (ACR16) belongs to a novel class of central nervous system compounds in development for the treatment of Huntington disease.  The objective of the study was to investigate the metabolic changes in patients with Huntington disease before and after pridopidine treatment.  METHODS: [(18)F]Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomographic imaging was used to measure the regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose at baseline and after 14 days of open-label pridopidine treatment in 8 patients with Huntington disease.   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that pridopidine induces metabolic changes in brain regions implicated as important for mediating compensatory mechanisms in Huntington disease.  In addition, the finding of a strong relationship between clinical severity and metabolic activity after treatment also suggests that pridopidine treatment targets a Huntington disease-related metabolic activity pattern.  The putative restoration of function in cortico-subcortical circuitry by pridopidine is likely to make it useful for ameliorating several neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Huntington's disease.

Kallikrein-related peptidase 3 (KLK3), which codes for prostate-specific antigen (PSA), is a well-known AR-regulated gene and its upstream enhancers produce bidirectional enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), termed KLK3e.  The distal enhancer of the gonadotropin hormone α-subunit gene, chorionic gonadotropin alpha (Cga), is responsible for Cga cell-specific expression in gonadotropes and thyrotropes, and we show here that it encodes two bidirectional nonpolyadenylated RNAs whose levels are increased somewhat by exposure to gonadotropin-releasing hormone but are not necessarily linked to Cga transcriptional activity.   A richer picture has taken shape, integrating transcription of coding genes, enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), and various other noncoding transcriptional events.  In this review we give an overview of recent studies detailing the mechanisms of RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II)-based transcriptional initiation and discuss the ways in which transcriptional direction is established as well as its functional implications.  XR-seq maps capture transcription-coupled repair at sites of divergent gene promoters and bidirectional enhancer RNA (eRNA) production at enhancers XR-seq maps capture transcription-coupled repair at sites of divergent gene promoters and bidirectional enhancer RNA (eRNA) production at enhancers.  The distal enhancer of the gonadotropin hormone α-subunit gene, chorionic gonadotropin alpha (Cga), is responsible for Cga cell-specific expression in gonadotropes and thyrotropes, and we show here that it encodes two bidirectional nonpolyadenylated RNAs whose levels are increased somewhat by exposure to gonadotropin-releasing hormone but are not necessarily linked to Cga transcriptional activity.  Using this approach, we have defined a class of primary transcripts (eRNAs) that are transcribed uni- or bidirectionally from estrogen receptor binding sites (ERBSs) with an average transcription unit length of ∼3-5 kb.  XR-seq maps capture transcription-coupled repair at sites of divergent gene promoters and bidirectional enhancer RNA (eRNA) production at enhancers.  We identify 76 enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), 40 canonical lncRNAs, 65 antisense lncRNAs and 35 regions of bidirectional transcription (RBT) that are differentially expressed in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS).  XR-seq maps capture transcription-coupled repair at sites of divergent gene promoters and bidirectional enhancer RNA (eRNA) production at enhancers.  Instead, communication between promoters and enhancers can be bidirectional with promoters required to activate enhancer transcription.  A new paradigm has emerged in recent years characterizing transcription initiation as a bidirectional process encompassing a larger proportion of the genome than previously thought.

"[SOC]###context: The second method, ""functional class scoring"" (FCS), examines the statistical distribution of individual gene scores among all genes in the gene ontology class and does not involve an initial gene selection step.  We aimed at examining such discrepancies on the level of apparently affected biologically related groups of genes, e. g.  metabolic or signalling pathways.  This can be achieved by group testing procedures, e. g.  over-representation analysis, functional class scoring (FCS), or global tests.  They also suggest that functional class scoring methods appear to perform better and more consistently than overrepresentation analysis and distributional score methods.  With the use of functional class scoring, a semi-supervised method exploring both the expression pattern and the functional annotation of the genes, the Gene Ontology classes were ranked according to the significance of the impact of D3T treatment.  Most of the existing pathway analysis methods focus on either the number of DE genes observed in a given pathway (enrichment analysis methods), or on the correlation between the pathway genes and the class of the samples (functional class scoring methods)  There are three main classes of these methods: over-representation analysis, functional class scoring, and pathway topology based methods.  Here, we show that all three major categories of pathway analysis methods (enrichment analysis, functional class scoring, and topology-based methods) are severely influenced by crosstalk phenomena Proteomics Expansion Pipeline (PEP), Functional Class Scoring (FCS), and Maxlink, in a test scenario of valproic acid (VPA)-treated mice.  We propose and examine personalized extensions of pathway statistics, overrepresentation analysis and functional class scoring, to generate individualized pathway aberrance score.  The comparison of two analytical approaches, based on either Over Representation Analysis or Functional Class Scoring, by a meta-analysis-based approach, led to the retrieval of known information about the biological situation - thus validating the model - but also more importantly to the discovery of the previously unknown implication of the spliceosome, the cellular machinery responsible for mRNA splicing, in the development of metastasis.

It is proposed that some patients with KCNJ11 mutations have neurological features that are part of a discrete neurological syndrome termed developmental Delay, Epilepsy and Neonatal Diabetes (DEND), but there are also neurological consequences of chronic or acute diabetes.  We report a case of developmental delay, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes (DEND) syndrome that shows neurologic improvement with sulfonylurea therapy.  Some patients have DEND syndrome (developmental delay, epilepsy and neonatal diabetes) with the neurological features arising from mutated KATP channels in muscle, nerve and brain.  Approximately 20% have associated neurologic features: the most severe form, which includes epilepsy and developmental delay, is called developmental delay, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes (DEND) syndrome and the milder form, with less severe developmental delay and without epilepsy, is designated intermediate DEND syndrome.  Intermediate developmental delay, epilepsy and neonatal diabetes mellitus (DEND) syndrome as a result of a 59V>M Kir6. 2 mutation.  Five patients with developmental delay, epilepsy and neonatal diabetes (DEND) syndrome had unique mutations not associated with other phenotypes.  Approximately 20% have associated neurologic features: the most severe form, which includes epilepsy and developmental delay, is called developmental delay, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes (DEND) syndrome and the milder form, with less severe developmental delay and without epilepsy, is designated intermediate DEND syndrome.  We have verified a lack of clinical response for both glycemic control and neurological features in an infant with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus and DEND syndrome due to a V59A mutation in the KCNJ11 gene.  Thus, our case reinforces that most cases with DEND syndrome are insensitive to SU.

"[SOC]###context: These proteins are targeted by chaperones and delivered to lysosomes where they are translocated into the lysosomal lumen and degraded via the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP-2A) Macroautophagy is followed by chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), in which Hsc70 (Heat shock cognate 70) selectively binds proteins with exposed KFERQ motifs and pushes them inside lysosomes through the LAMP-2A (Lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A) receptor.  CMA activity has been shown to be proportional to levels of the CMA receptor Lamp-2a.  Lysosomes from livers of lipid-challenged mice had a marked decrease in the levels of the CMA receptor, the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A, We report that Bcl-2-related early rod apoptosis was associated with the upregulation of autophagy markers including chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) substrate receptor LAMP-2 we examined gene expression levels of lysosome-associated membrane 2 (LAMP-2), a CMA receptor The lysosomal-membrane protein type 2A (LAMP-2A) acts as the receptor for the substrates of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a selective type of autophagy by which specific cytosolic proteins are sent to lysosomes for degradation.  Substrate proteins bind to the lysosomal membrane through the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP-2A), one of the three splice variants of the lamp2 gene, and this binding is limiting for their degradation via CMA.  Substrate proteins only bind to monomeric LAMP-2A, while the efficient translocation of substrates requires the formation of a particular high-molecular-weight LAMP-2A complex We recently reported that UCH-L1 physically interacts with LAMP-2A, the lysosomal receptor for chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA In this study, we found that UCH-L1 physically interacts with LAMP-2A, the lysosomal receptor for CMA, We have previously described an age-related decline in chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), a selective form of autophagy, by which particular cytosolic proteins are delivered to lysosomes after binding to the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP-2A), a receptor for this pathway.  Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a selective pathway for the degradation of cytosolic proteins in lysosomes.  CMA declines with age because of a decrease in the levels of lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP) type 2A, a lysosomal receptor for this pathway.  Oxidation-induced activation of CMA correlates with higher levels of several components of the lysosomal translocation complex, but in particular of the lumenal chaperone, required for substrate uptake, and of the lysosomal membrane protein (lamp) type 2a, previously identified as a receptor for this pathway.  We now demonstrate that this protease activity triggers the degradation of the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2a (lamp2a), a receptor for chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA).  We have previously identified this receptor as the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2a (lamp2a) Lamp2a acts as a receptor in the lysosomal membrane for substrate proteins of chaperone-mediated autophagy.  These characteristics may be important for lamp2a to act as a receptor for chaperone-mediated autophagy.  A progressive age-related decrease in the levels of the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2a that acts as a receptor for chaperone-mediated autophagy Hsc70 and Hsp40 are members of a molecular chaperone complex required for protein transport into the lysosome during chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA).  Once there, substrate proteins bind to the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2 isoform A (LAMP2A), inducing assembly of this receptor protein into a higher molecular weight protein complex that is used by the substrate proteins to reach the lysosomal lumen.   Protein substrates bind to a receptor in the lysosomal membrane, the lysosome-associated membrane protein (lamp) type 2a. 
###question: Which is the receptor for substrates of Chaperone Mediated Autophagy?[EOC] [SOR]###response: Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a lysosomal pathway for selective removal of damaged cytosolic proteins.  The LAMP2A (Lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 isoform A) functions as a receptor for cytosolic proteins and also as essential component of the CMA translocation complex [28].  Cytosolic substrate proteins bind to monomers of LAMP-2A, which then multimerizes to form the complex required for substrate transmembrane import. [EOR]"

"[SOC]###context: As a barrier to metastasis of cancer, cells that lost contact with the neighbouring cells or extracellular matrix(Extracellular matrix, ECM) will be subjected to apoptosis.  This cell death process has been termed ""anoikis"".  When normal epithelial cells or solid tumor cells without metastatic potential detach from the primary site, and then enter into the circulatory system, the anoikis mechanism will be activated.  The significance of anoikis is to prevent the shedding cells from growing and implanting into other inappropriate sites.   Anoikis is a programmed cell death induced upon cell detachment from extracellular matrix, behaving as a critical mechanism in preventing adherent-independent cell growth and attachment to an inappropriate matrix, thus avoiding colonizing of distant organs.   As a barrier to metastasis, cells normally undergo an apoptotic process known as ""anoikis,"" a form of cell death due to loss of contact with the extracellular matrix or neighboring cells.  Anoikis is a programmed cell death occurring upon cell detachment from the correct extracellular matrix, thus disrupting integrin ligation.  It is a critical mechanism in preventing dysplastic cell growth or attachment to an inappropriate matrix.  Anoikis prevents detached epithelial cells from colonizing elsewhere and is thus essential for tissue homeostasis and development.   Detachment from the extracellular matrix induces a form of programmed cell death termed anoikis.  Resistance to anoikis permits cancer cells to survive in systemic circulation and facilitates their metastasis to distant organs.  Anoikis - apoptotic cell death triggered by loss of extracellular matrix (ECM) contacts - is dysregulated in many chronic debilitating and fatal diseases.  The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a key role in cell-cell communication and signaling, and the signals it propagates are important for tissue remodeling and survival.  However, signals from disease-altered ECM may lead to anoikis-apoptotic cell death triggered by loss of ECM contacts.  Anoikis is a mode of apoptotic cell death, consequential to insufficient cell-matrix interactions and a critical player in tumor angiogenesis and metastasis.  Anoikis is also a physiologic process in normal cells used to maintain homeostasis, in which cell death is induced in response to loss of extracellular membrane (ECM) attachment.  Cancer cells are notoriously resistant to anoikis, enabling metastasis and new tumor growth beyond their original environment.  Anoikis is a subtype of apoptosis induced by detachment of adherent cells from the extracellular matrix.  Developed organs display strict spatial organization of differentiated cells which is required for proper organ function.  One important device that prevents tissue disorganization is the death of cells that lose anchorage to their native matrix, a signal that indicates potential loss of proper tissue context.  Termed anoikis (Greek for Homelessness), this form of cell death is a specialized form of apoptosis.  As a barrier to metastases, cells normally undergo apoptosis after they lose contact with their extra cellular matrix or their neighbouring cells.  This cell death process has been termed ""anoikis"".  Tumour cells that acquire malignant potential have developed mechanisms to resist anoikis and thereby survive after detachment from their primary site and while travelling through the lymphatic and circulatory systems.  Epithelial cells require attachment to extracellular matrix (ECM) to suppress an apoptotic cell death program termed anoikis.   Detachment of adherent epithelial cells from the extracellular matrix induces apoptosis, known as anoikis.  Integrin stimulation protects cells from anoikis, but the responsible mechanisms are not well known.  Apoptosis triggered by cell detachment from the extracellular matrix, which occurs during hepatocyte isolation, is a phenomenon termed ""anoikis"".  It's importance in the normal physiologic development of the human body, as well as in disease states, has been described.  Cancer cells harbor anoikis resistance allowing spread to occur.  Anoïkis is defined as programmed cell death induced by the loss of cell/matrix interactions.  Adhesion to structural glycoproteins of the extracellular matrix is necessary for survival of the differentiated adherent cells in the cardiovascular system, including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and cardiac myocytes.  Adhesion is also a key factor for the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells.  In particular, fibronectin is considered a factor of survival and differentiation for many adherent cells.  Adhesion generates cell tensional integrity (tensegrity) and repression of apoptotic signals, whereas detachment has the opposite effect.  Anoïkis plays a physiological role by regulating cell homeostasis in tissues.  Anoikis is a special type of programmed cell death after loss of cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions.  Detachment-induced cell death, or anoikis, is a type of apoptosis that occurs when epithelial cells lose their attachment to the extracellular matrix.  Anoikis is a type of apoptosis due to the detachment from the extracellular matrix and neighboring cells.  Detachment of adherent epithelial cells from the extracellular matrix induces apoptosis, known as anoikis.

"[SOC]###context: lasmodium falciparum the main causative agent of malaria is an important public health vector.  Plasmodium falciparum the main causative agent of malaria is an important public health vector.  < Overcoming antigenic variation is one of the major challenges in the development of an effective vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum, a causative agent of human malaria.  [The vivax malaria causative agent Plasmodium ovale: the present global area, intraspecies polymorphism, importation to the Russian Federation (1992-2011)].  The global area for Plasmodium ovale is small as compared with that for other species of human malaria pathogens.  Parasites that have been described to affect the central nervous system (CNS), either as the dominant or as a collateral feature, include cestodes (Taenia solium (neurocysticerciasis), Echinococcus granulosus (cerebral cystic echinococcosis), E.  multilocularis (cerebral alveolar echinococcosis), Spirometra mansoni (neurosparganosis)), nematodes (Toxocara canis and T.  cati (neurotoxocariasis), Trichinella spiralis (neurotrichinelliasis), Angiostrongylus cantonensis and A.  costaricensis (neuroangiostrongyliasis), Gnathostoma spinigerum (gnathostomiasis)), trematodes (Schistosoma mansoni (cerebral bilharziosis), Paragonimus westermani (neuroparagonimiasis)), or protozoa (Toxoplasma gondii (neurotoxoplasmosis), Acanthamoeba spp.  or Balamuthia mandrillaris (granulomatous amoebic encephalitis), Naegleria (primary amoebic meningo-encephalitis), Entamoeba histolytica (brain abscess), Plasmodium falciparum (cerebral malaria), Trypanosoma brucei gambiense/rhodesiense (sleeping sickness) or Trypanosoma cruzi (cerebral Chagas disease)) Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of malaria, a deadly infectious disease for which treatments are scarce and drug-resistant parasites are now increasingly found.  In contrast, it has been thought that Plasmodium spp. , the causative agent of malaria, rely mainly on cytosolic glycolysis but not mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation for energy production during blood stages.  Whereas no biological activity was previously identified for 1, the material derived from the efficient synthesis enabled additional bioactivity tests leading to the identification of a notable activity against insect cells and Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria.  Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, encodes an SSB protein that localizes to the apicoplast and likely functions in the replication and maintenance of its genome.  While observing cells by time-lapse imaging is a standard procedure in many systems, this technique was until recently not available for blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most severe form of human malaria.  The causative agent of malaria, Plasmodium, possesses three translationally active compartments: the cytosol, the mitochondrion and a relic plastid called the apicoplast.  The merozoite surface protein (MSP)-1 of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria tropica, is considered to be a promising vaccine candidate.  The genus Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, has the smallest mt genome in the form of a tandemly repeated, linear element of 6 kb.  The culminating step of the intraerythrocytic development of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, is the spectacular release of multiple invasive merozoites on rupture of the infected erythrocyte membrane.  Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of human malaria, lacks a conventional tricarboxylic acid cycle and depends exclusively on glycolysis for ATP production.  Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most deadly form of human malaria, is unable to salvage pyrimidines and must rely on de novo biosynthesis for survival.  The Hsp90 protein from the parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, is critical for this organism's survival; the anti-Hsp90 drug geldanamycin is toxic to P.  falciparum growth.  A novel family of 1H-imidazol-2-yl-pyrimidine-4,6-diamines has been identified with potent activity against the erythrocyte-stage of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), the most common causative agent of malaria.  The Plasmodium parasite, causative agent of malaria, infects RBC that are phagocytosed by DC and macrophages during the course of infection.  Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of malaria, a disease where new drug targets are required due to increasing resistance to current anti-malarials.  Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of human malaria, invades host erythrocytes using several proteins on the surface of the invasive merozoite, which have been proposed as potential vaccine candidates.  Few studies have investigated the pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for what seems to be a possible interaction between Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, and HIV-1 in dually infected patients.  We show that orthochromatic cells are the earliest stages that may be invaded by Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of fatal human malaria.  Infection by Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, is associated with hemolysis and therefore with release of hemoglobin from RBC.  Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malignant malaria, is among the most severe human infectious diseases Plasmodium falciparum, the most important causative agent of human malaria, undergoes antigenic variation as a means of prolonging infection and ensuring transmission between hosts.  L-Malate dehydrogenase (PfMDH) from Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent for the most severe form of malaria, has shown remarkable similarities to L: -lactate dehydrogenase (PfLDH).  FQ is able to overcome the chloroquine (CQ) resistance problem, an important limit to the control of Plasmodium falciparum, the principal causative agent of malaria.  The causative agent of malaria, Plasmodium falciparum posses a single aquaglyceroporin (PfAQP) which represents a potential drug target for treatment of the disease.  An essential requisite for transmission of Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, is the successful completion of a complex developmental cycle in its mosquito vector.  In Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of cerebral malaria, silent information regulator 2 (Sir2) has been implicated in pathogenesis through its role in var gene silencing.  Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of human malaria, is totally dependent on de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway.  Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the fatal form of malaria, synthesizes GMP primarily from IMP and, hence, needs active GMPS (GMP synthetase) for its survival.  Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most severe type of malaria, a life-threatening disease affecting the lives of over three billion people.  Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most serious form of malaria, infects about 5-10% of the world human population per year.  Plasmodium vivax is an important human pathogen causing malaria in more temperate climates of the world.  Similar to Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent for malaria tropica, drug resistance is beginning to emerge for this parasite species and this hampers adequate treatment of infection.  Malaria kills more than one million people a year, and understanding the historical association between its most notorious causative agent, Plasmodium falciparum, and its mosquito vectors is important in fighting the disease.  We show here that macrophages are mandatory for NK cell IFN-gamma secretion in response to erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), a causative agent of human malaria.  Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most severe and mortal type of malaria.  Plasmodium falciparum is the main causative agent of tropical malaria, the most severe parasitic disease in the world.  Growing resistance of Plasmodia towards available drugs is an increasing problem in countries where malaria is endemic.  The presence of antisense RNA in Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of severe malaria, remains controversial.  Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, is sensitive to oxidative stress and therefore the family of antioxidant enzymes, peroxiredoxins (Prxs) represent a target for antimalarial drug design.  In the Republic of Yemen, Plasmodium falciparum is the predominant causative agent of malaria and is associated with adverse consequences for pregnant women and their babies.  Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most lethal form of human malaria, uses multiple ligand-receptor interactions to invade host red blood cells (RBCs).  Comparative genomic analysis of the malaria causative agent, Plasmodium falciparum, with other eukaryotes for which the complete genome is available, revealed that the genome from P.  falciparum was more similar to the genome of a plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, than to other non-apicomplexan taxa.  Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most lethal form of human malaria, totally depends on de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway.  Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, relies extensively on glycolysis coupled with homolactic fermentation during its blood-borne stages for energy production.  Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most severe form of human malaria.  The rapid multiplication of the parasite within human erythrocytes requires an active production of new membranes.  Seven sPLA(2)s from groups IA, IB, IIA and III, were tested here in different culture conditions for inhibition of the in vitro intraerythrocytic development of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most severe form of human malaria Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most lethal form of human malaria, relies on de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis.  In spite of research efforts to develop vaccines against the causative agent of human malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, effective control remains elusive.  Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, has to undergo sexual differentiation and development in anopheline mosquitoes for transmission to occur.  For Plasmodium falciparum, a causative agent of tropical malaria, TrxR is an essential protein which has been validated as a drug target.  Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, must first infect hepatocytes to initiate a mammalian infection.  Cyclin dependent protein kinases (CDKs) have become attractive drug targets in an effort to identify effective inhibitors of the parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most severe form of human malaria.  It is well established that protection against one such disease, malaria, requires strong CD8(+) T cell responses targeted against the liver stages of the causative agent, Plasmodium spp.  A novel method for the in vitro detection of the protozoan Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, has been developed.  Trypanosomes do not inhabit or grow in anopheles mosquitoes, the vector for the transmission of Plasmodium parasites the causative agent for malaria.  The genome sequence of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most severe form of malaria in humans, rapidly approaches completion, but our ability to genetically manipulate this organism remains limited.  It is caused by a number of species of the genus Plasmodium, and Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most lethal form.  To complete its life cycle in the mosquito, Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, has to traverse the epithelia of the midgut and salivary glands.  In Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of human malaria, the catalytic subunit gene of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Pfpka-c) exists as a single copy.  Sulfadoxine is the most extensively used drug of this group of drugs and is usually combined with pyrimethamine (Fansidar), particularly for the control of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most lethal form of malaria.  Resistance to the sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine combination is widespread.  A putative glutathione peroxidase gene (Swiss-Prot accession number Z 68200) of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of tropical malaria, was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity.  Apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) is an asexual blood-stage protein expressed in the invasive merozoite form of Plasmodia species, which are the causative agent of malaria.  In the case of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria tropica, this approach is especially interesting, because here both key enzymes, ODC and AdoMetDC, are combined in a bifunctional protein, ODC/AdoMetDC.  Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most lethal form of human malaria, is incapable of de novo purine synthesis, and thus, purine acquisition from the host is an indispensable nutritional requirement.  A laboratory model of circulation of the malaria causative agent P.  gallinaceum has been used to show that the effect of precocene (antijuvenoid) leads to a statistically significant reduction in the proportion of infected females developing eggs after blood suction.  A cell-free incubation system prepared from asexual erythrocytic stages of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria in humans, is capable of synthesizing the same spectrum of GPIs as that found in metabolically labelled parasites.  The Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasite is the causative agent of malaria tropica.  The gene of an NADP+-specific glutamate dehydrogenase was cloned from Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of tropical malaria.  This study describes the synergistic interaction of two calcium channel blockers, verapamil (VR) and SR33557 or fantofarone (SR), in reversing chloroquine resistance in Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of human malaria.  Plasmodium falciparum is the major causative agent of malaria, a disease of worldwide importance.  Two enzymes were purified to homogeneity from the intraerythrocytic malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum: glutathione disulfide reductase, an antioxidative enzyme, which appears to play an essential role for parasite growth and differentiation, and glutamate dehydrogenase, an enzyme not occurring in the host erythrocyte.  The paper provides evidence that the An.  sacharovi females which do not develop mature eggs after blood-sucking on the malaria-infected donor could not be infected by the bird malaria agent P.  gallinaceum.  Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of malaria tropica in man.  Plastid origin of an extrachromosomal DNA molecule from Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria.  [New models of the circulation of the causative agent of malaria Plasmodium gallinaceum using malarial mosquitoes in the fauna of the USSR].  [Experimental research on the effect of biologically active substances on the susceptibility of mosquitoes to the causative agent of malaria.  3.  Algae, fertilizers].  On a model pair Aedes aegypti--Plasmodium gallinaceum in has been shown that changes in the conditions of larvae development caused by the addition into the water medium of the live culture of Synochocystis sp.  cyanobacteria or green seaweeds Chlorella vulgaris, acetone extracts from the live culture precipitate or Chlorella powder, as well as nitrogen-containing fertilizer--ammonium chloride did not lower the sensitivity of the imago flying to malaria parasites.  The mechanism of chloroquine resistance has not been known but recent evidence from Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most severe form of human malaria, suggested similarities to the multidrug resistance phenotype (MDR) of mammalian tumour cells which is mediated by a protein molecule termed P-glycoprotein.  The feasibility was determined of influencing Ae.  aegypti sensitivity to bird malaria agent P.  gallinaceum by sublethal concentrations of herbicides (ordram and propanide) and fungicides (fundozol and blue vitriol) introduced into the larvae habitation medium or into the imago feed.  [An experimental study of the effect of different biologically active substances on the susceptibility of mosquitoes to the causative agent of malaria.  1.  Insect development regulators].  It has been shown on the model pair Ae.  aegypti-P.  gallinaceum that dimilin, an inhibitor of insect chitin synthesis has practically no effect on female sensitivity to malaria agent.  [The absence of an action of the pyrethroids deltamethrin and cypermethrin on mosquito susceptibility to the causative agent of malaria].  Mosquitos Ae.  aegypti and An.  stephensi contact with sublethal doses of deltametrin and cypermetrin pyretroids at larval stage and in grown state, when diet includes sugar with pyretroids, had no influence on the sensitivity of survived females to malaria agents P.  gallinaceum and P.  berghei.  This prompted us to purify and characterize the topoisomerases I and II present in the erythrocytes of protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, in order to later use these enzymatic systems in antimalarial drug assays.  The problem of drug resistance of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of tropical malaria and its role in the general system of malaria control are discussed.  [Effect of mosquito contact with DDT and their susceptibility to the causative agent of malaria].  [Lack of an effect from repeated blood sucking by mosquitoes on their infectivity with the causative agent of malaria].  The lack of repeated bloodsucking does not affect essentially the infection of Ae.  aegypti mosquitoes with malaria agent, P.  gallinaceum.  High resolution 31P-NMR has been used for the non-invasive observation of metabolites and metabolic rates in blood of normal mice and of mice infected with Plasmodium berghei, the causative agent of malaria.  BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum the main causative agent of malaria is an important public health vector.  The effectiveness of methylene blue (MB) combined with pyrimethamine (PYR), chloroquine (CQ) or quinine (Q) was examined in a classical four-day suppressive test against a causative agent of rodent malaria, Plasmodium berghei.  Infection by Plasmodium species, the causative agent of malaria, is currently treated with drug-based therapies, but an increase in drug resistance has led to the need for new methods of treatment.  BACKGROUND: The merozoite surface protein (MSP)-1 of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria tropica, is considered to be a promising vaccine candidate.  The 23-megabase genome of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of severe human malaria, contains ∼5300 genes, most of unknown function or lacking homologs in other organisms.  Results of the present study indicate that malaria is endemic in Nouakchott and that P.  vivax is the principal causative agent.  Plasmodium vivax was the main causative agent followed by Plasmodium falciparum.  Toxoplasma gondii is a member of the phylum Apicomplexa that includes several important human pathogens, such as Cryptosporidium and Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of human malaria.  Plasmodium falciparum, the major causative agent of human malaria, contains three separate genomes.  Plasmodium parasites, the causative agent of malaria, are transmitted through the bites of infected Anopheles mosquitoes resulting in over 250 million new infections each year.  The genus Plasmodium, causative agent of malaria, of the phylum Apicomplexa, has the smallest mt genome in the form of a circular and/or tandemly repeated linear element of 6 kb, encoding only three protein genes (cox1, cox3, and cob).  Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most lethal form of human malaria.  In Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most lethal form of malaria, fatty acid biosynthesis occurs in the apicoplast organelle during the liver stage of the parasite life cycle.  Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malignant malaria, is among the most severe human infectious diseases.  For transmission to occur, Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, must complete a complex developmental cycle in its mosquito vector.  FQ is able to overcome the CQ resistance problem, an important limit to the control of Plasmodium falciparum, the principal causative agent of malaria.  Some lycorine ester derivatives including LT1 were examined for their inhibitory activity against Trypanosoma brucei brucei, the parasite associated with sleeping sickness, and against Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria.  A three-dimensional structure of histo-aspartic protease (HAP), a pepsin-like enzyme from the causative agent of malaria Plasmodium falciparum, is suggested on the basis of homologous modeling followed by equilibration by the method of molecular dynamics.  BACKGROUND: Understanding gene regulation in Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, is an important step in deciphering its complex life cycle as well as leading to possible new targets for therapeutic applications.  Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, relies on a complex protein-secretion system for protein targeting into numerous subcellular destinations.  We have evaluated a technology called transcriptionally active PCR (TAP) for high throughput identification and prioritization of novel target antigens from genomic sequence data using the Plasmodium parasite, the causative agent of malaria, as a model. 
###question: Which is the causative agent of malaria?[EOC] [SOR]###response: Four Plasmodium species commonly infect humans (Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale).  Plasmodium falciparum infects about 5-10% of the world human population per year and it is the causative agent of the most severe and lethal form of malaria.  P.  falciparum  causes fatal cerebral malaria and is responsible for most deaths, particularly in pregnant women and children under the age of five.  P.  falciparum is transmitted to the human host by Anopheles mosquitoes and is the most tremendous malaria vector in sub-Saharan Africa.  Plasmodium vivax is the causative agent of benign malaria in more temperate climates of the world.  Plasmodium gallinaceum is the main bird malaria causative agent and  Plasmodium yoelli is the principle rodent malaria agent. [EOR]"

"[SOC]###context: Phototoxicity of Doxycycline: A Systematic Review on Clinical Manifestations, Frequency, Cofactors, and Prevention.  BACKGROUND: One of the most important dermatologic side effects of doxycycline is photosensitivity.   While there are many publications on the phototoxicity of tetracyclines in general, only a few exist focusing on doxycycline.   Clinical symptoms vary from light sunburn-like sensation (burning, erythema) to large-area photodermatitis.   CONCLUSION: Evidence base must be improved for giving advice on appropriate prevention measures to travelers taking doxycycline and having a risk of significant sun exposure.  Based on the available evidence, our best estimates of absolute effect for mefloquine versus doxycyline were: 2% versus 2% for discontinuation, 12% versus 3% for insomnia, 31% versus 3% for abnormal dreams, 18% versus 1% for anxiety, 11% versus 1% for depressed mood, 4% versus 14% for dyspepsia, 2% versus 19% for photosensitivity, 1% versus 5% for vomiting, and 2% versus 16% for vaginal thrush.  Many drugs are responsible for this phototoxic reaction, especially tetracyclines, psoralens, chloramphenicol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, fluoroquinolones, and, rarely, doxycycline.   OBJECTIVES: Many patients undergoing long-term doxycycline treatment do not regularly take their treatment because of photosensitivity.  Modulation of Melanogenesis and Antioxidant Status of Melanocytes in Response to Phototoxic Action of Doxycycline.  Doxycycline is a commonly used tetracycline antibiotic showing the broad spectrum of antibacterial action.  However, the use of this antibiotic is often connected with the risk of phototoxic reactions that lead to various skin disorders.  The results obtained in vitro may explain the mechanisms of phototoxic reactions that occur in normal human epidermal melanocytes in vivo after exposure of skin to doxycycline and UVA radiation.  Treatment with doxycycline is cheap and relatively safe, but gastrointestinal symptoms and photosensitivity reactions can be expected more often than with ceftriaxone. <br> <b>OBJECTIVES</b>: Many patients undergoing long-term doxycycline treatment do not regularly take their treatment because of photosensitivity.  Photosensitivity reactions and gastrointestinal symptoms were noted more often among patients receiving doxycycline than in those receiving ceftriaxone.  Thus, the action spectra of the drug photosensitivity patients were plotted and compared with those of 12 nonphotosensitive control patients: 10 patients were found to be photosensitive in the UVA range; the implicated drugs included quinine, sparfloxacin, amiodarone, doxycycline, mefenamic acid, nalidixic acid, fenbrufen, diclofenac, enalapril, diltiazem and prochlorperazine maleate.  One patient on doxycycline was photosensitive in both the UVA and UVB ranges.  Treatment with doxycycline is cheap and relatively safe, but gastrointestinal symptoms and photosensitivity reactions can be expected more often than with ceftriaxone.  Anti-inflammatory-dose doxycycline should not be used by individuals with known hypersensitivity to tetracyclines or increased photosensitivity, or by pregnant or nursing women (anti-inflammatory-dose doxycycline is a pregnancy category-D medication).  <b>BACKGROUND</b>: One of the most important dermatologic side effects of doxycycline is photosensitivity.  One of the most important dermatologic side effects of doxycycline is photosensitivity.  One patient experienced mild photosensitivity from doxycycline but continued to take it.  Participants in the doxycycline group had a higher incidence of nausea and photosensitivity.

"[SOC]###context: gamma-Secretase is critically involved in the Notch pathway and in Alzheimer's disease.   Presenilins are the catalytic subunit of the large gamma-secretase complex, that promotes intramembranous proteolysis of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), resulting in the production of beta-amyloid (A beta).  Mutant presenilin causes early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), is related to abnormal Ca(2+) signaling, and render cells vulnerable to cell death.   Presenilins form the catalytic part of the gamma-secretases, protein complexes that are responsible for the intramembranous cleavage of transmembrane proteins.  The presenilins are involved in several biological functions, but are best known for their role in the generation of the beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide in Alzheimer's disease and are therefore thought to be important drug targets for this disorder.  Amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) generated by proteolysis of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD).   The gamma-secretase complex has a decisive role in the development of Alzheimer's disease, in that it cleaves a precursor to create the amyloid beta peptide whose aggregates form the senile plaques encountered in the brains of patients.  Gamma-secretase is a member of the intramembrane-cleaving proteases which process their transmembrane substrates within the bilayer.  The GxxxG motif in the transmembrane domain of AbetaPP plays an essential role in the interaction of CTF beta with the gamma-secretase complex and the formation of amyloid-beta.  Gamma-secretase-mediated processing of the amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) is a crucial step in the formation of the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), but little is known about how the substrate AbetaPP interacts with the gamma-secretase complex.   Thus, the present study revealed an essential role for the GxxxG motif in the interaction of AbetaPP with the gamma-secretase complex and the formation of Abeta.  Taken together, our results suggest an important role of hypoxia in modulating the APP processing by facilitating both beta- and gamma-cleavage which may result in a significant increase of Abeta generation.  The gamma-secretase, composed of presenilin-1 (PS1) or presenilin-2 (PS2), nicastrin (NCT), anterior pharynx-defective phenotype 1 (APH-1), and PEN-2, is critical for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD).   APP is a ubiquitous membrane protein that is physiologically processed by site-specific proteolysis firstly by alpha- or beta-secretases, releasing a large fragment called APP(S) that contains most of the extracellular sequences of APP, a small extracellular stub, the transmembrane region and the cytoplasmic tail of APP (;AICD'-APP intracellular domain).  These are subsequently cleaved by gamma-secretase at multiple sites in the transmembrane region, releasing small peptides, Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42), the major components of AD-associated amyloid fibrils.   As PS1 has been shown to play a critical role in facilitating gamma-secretase activity, and mutations in this protein are associated with familial AD (FAD), we have cloned it from SAMP8 mouse hippocampus and compared its sequence with those of other species.  An increased amount or mutation(s) in PS1, which alters the stoichiometric balance of the gamma-secretase complex, may be the cause of aberrant or increased processing of APP, resulting in Abeta accumulation leading to loss of memory.  The gamma-secretase complex plays a role in Alzheimer's disease and cancer progression.   The gamma-secretase complex plays a role in Alzheimer's disease and cancer progression.  Suppressor Mutations for Presenilin 1 Familial Alzheimer Disease Mutants Modulate γ-Secretase Activities Synthesis and SAR Studies of Fused Oxadiazines as γ-Secretase Modulators for Treatment of Alzheimers Disease Pathological activity of familial Alzheimer's disease-associated mutant presenilin can be executed by six different gamma-secretase complexes.  The reconstituted enzyme processes C99 and the Notch-like substrate N160 and displays the characteristic features of gamma-secretase in terms of sensitivity to a gamma-secretase inhibitor, upregulation of Abeta42 production by a familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) mutation in the APP gene, and downregulation of Notch processing by PS1 FAD mutations.   The Aph1B complex contributes to total gamma-secretase activity in the human brain, and thus specific targeting of Aph1B-containing gamma-secretase complexes may help generate less toxic therapies for Alzheimer's disease.  Genetic analysis of familial Alzheimer's disease has revealed that mutations in the gamma-secretase enzyme presenilin promote toxic Abeta secretion; however, presenilin mutations might also influence tau hyperphosphorylation and neurodegeneration through gamma-secretase-independent mechanisms.   Here, we show that familial Alzheimer's disease mutations clustered near the sites of gamma-secretase cleavage actually decrease gamma-secretase-mediated release of the intracellular fragment of APP (CTFgamma).   Beside the well investigated role of presenilins as the catalytic unit in γ-secretase complex, their involvement in regulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis has recently come into more focus of Alzheimer's disease research.  The γ-secretase complex is a promising target in Alzheimer's disease because of its role in the amyloidogenic processing of β-amyloid precursor protein.  Genetic studies of early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease cases revealed causative mutations in the genes encoding β-amyloid precursor protein and the γ-secretase-complex components presenilin-1 and presenilin-2, supporting an important role of β-amyloid in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.  Assembly, maturation, and trafficking of the gamma-secretase complex in Alzheimer's disease.  Gamma-secretase was first recognized because of its role in the production of Abeta peptides that are pathogenic in Alzheimer's disease.  Regulation of gamma-secretase activity in Alzheimer's disease.  Drugs that regulate the production of Abeta by inhibiting or modulating gamma-secretase activity could provide a disease-modifying effect on Alzheimer's disease, although recent studies suggest that gamma-secretase plays important roles in cellular signaling including Notch.  The Aph1B complex contributes to total gamma-secretase activity in the human brain, and thus specific targeting of Aph1B-containing gamma-secretase complexes may help generate less toxic therapies for Alzheimer's disease. .  The gamma-secretase complex is therefore believed to be critical in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.  gamma-Secretase heterogeneity in the Aph1 subunit: relevance for Alzheimer's disease.

"[SOC]###context: The use of methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis.  Historical perspective on the use of methotrexate for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.  Aminopterin, a folic acid analogue was first reported in 1948 to produce temporary remission of acute leukemia of children, was also reported in 1951 to produce an important and rapid improvement in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriasis The safety and efficacy of the use of methotrexate in long-term therapy for rheumatoid arthritis.  Methotrexate (MTX) is currently under study for use in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.   The rational use of methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis and other rheumatic diseases.  Methotrexate-induced hepatic cirrhosis is less common in rheumatoid arthritis than previously thought, although its occurrence in psoriasis is probably higher than in rheumatoid arthritis.   Methotrexate is clearly effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and may be able to decrease the rate of formation of new bony erosions.   The use of methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis.  Review of the international literature on the clinical use of MTX in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease.  MTX has emerged as a relatively safe and effective treatment for RA that compares favorably with other therapies, particularly because of its considerably longer median drug survival.  The objective of this review is to update the recommendations of the 2010 Italian Consensus on the use of methotrexate (MTX) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other rheumatic diseases A new recommendation for patients with RA who are in MTX-induced clinical remission was also proposed and approved by the panel.  Updated recommendations for the use of MTX in patients with RA or other rheumatologic disease are proposed.  Methotrexate has been used in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) since the 1980s and to this day is often the first line medication for RA treatment.  OBJECTIVE: Most recommendations for the use of methotrexate (MTX) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are issued by developed countries.  Low dose pulse methotrexate (MTX) has become a widely used therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) because of its good response rate profile.  With Treatment with methotrexate (MTX) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can lead to severe side-effects, especially pulmonary and haematological complications.  The ai Patients having rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with methotrexate (MTX) are at an increased risk of developing lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD).  Epstei Increasingly, methotrexate (MTX) and sulphasalazine (SASP) are used initially for second-line therapy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  Althoug OBJECTIVES: The folate antagonist methotrexate (MTX) has become established as the most commonly used disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but is commonly discontinued due to adverse effe e suspected methotrexate (MTX)-associated lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD) induced by MTX treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  About  BACKGROUND: Treatment with methotrexate (MTX) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) leads to decreased total immunoglobulin (Ig) levels and impairs vaccine-specific IgG antibody levels following pneumococcal vaccinat In rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, the concomitant use of methotrexate has been shown to reduce the incidence of antibodies to infliximab (ATI), on the other hand, it is unclear whether azathioprine can reduce ATI production.  We enro Methotrexate (MTX) is known as a first-line synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  Biological treatments are expensive and using SC methotrexate can improve disease control in RA patients, thus potentially avoiding or delaying the requirement for future biological treatment.  Most recommendations for the use of methotrexate (MTX) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are issued by developed countries.  We reviewed existing recommendations on the use of MTX for the treatment of RA and summarized areas of agreement that could be relevant for least developed countries (LDCs). M st covered some but not all of the following areas: baseline ""pre-MTX"" assessment (7/12;58%), prescription of MTX (10/12;83. 3%), management of MTX side effects (6/12;50%), and special considerations (e. g. , peri-operative management) (8/12; 66. 7%).  R lectronic databases and registries were searched for recommendations on MTX use in RA, duplicates were eliminated, and the most updated version adopted when there were several versions on the same recommendation.   MTX must at the present time be used only in severe RA, refractory to more than one classical slow acting drug.  MTX is as effective in treating RA as the other second line drugs and always more rapidly effective, perhaps because of anti-inflammatory properties.  For the low doses used in RA (less than 15 mg/week), MTX is completely and rapidly absorbed with an active process membrane transport.  Methotrexate, which is used for RA treatment, causes thrombocytopenia.  Methorexate therapy in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis complicated by idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.  This case shows that methotrexate may be used in patients diagnosed with RA that is associated with ITP under strict monitoring.  Here, we report an RA case that also had ITP, which did not decrease in platelet count after methotrexate therapy.  We started methotrexate therapy 10 mg per week for treatment of RA, and hydroxychloroquine therapy was stopped due to nonresponse.  Methotrexate (MTX) is the anchor treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and has been very thoroughly studied in many different patient populations, as monotherapy and in combination with various other disease modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologic agents, as they became available.  Although rheumatologists have been using methotrexate in the treatment of RA for some time, controlled studies have been needed to establish the safety and efficacy of this agent.  Methotrexate is generally the first-line drug for the treatment of RA, psoriatic arthritis and other forms of inflammatory arthritis, and it enhances the effect of most biologic agents in RA.  Despite the introduction of numerous biologic agents for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other forms of inflammatory arthritis, low-dose methotrexate therapy remains the gold standard in RA therapy.  A number of studies show the efficacy of methotrexate (MTX) for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in general.  Methotrexate (MTX) is currently the most frequently used drugs in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  Methotrexate (MTX) has been the anchor treatment in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) over the last 15 years, and is used in combination with biologic agents to enhance efficacy over the last decade or so.

"[SOC]###context: RIP regulates signaling pathways by abrogating or releasing signaling molecules.  Since the discovery, already >15 years ago, of its catalytic component, presenilin, and even much earlier with the identification of amyloid precursor protein as its first substrate, γ-secretase has been commonly associated with Alzheimer's disease.  However, starting with Notch and thereafter a continuously increasing number of novel substrates, γ-secretase is becoming linked to an equally broader range of biological processes.  In the last decade, increasing evidence has pointed out an important role of this pathway beyond embryonic development, indicating that Notch also displays a critical function in the mature brain of vertebrates and invertebrates.  This pathway appears to be involved in neural progenitor regulation, neuronal connectivity, synaptic plasticity and learning/memory.  In addition, Notch appears to be aberrantly regulated in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and ischemic injury Along with β-secretase, this enzyme produces the amyloid β-protein of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from the amyloid β-protein precursor.  Because of its key role in the pathogenesis of AD, γ-secretase has been a prime target for drug discovery, and many inhibitors of this protease have been developed.  The therapeutic potential of these inhibitors is virtually negated by the fact that γ-secretase is an essential part of the Notch signaling pathway, rendering the compounds unacceptably toxic upon chronic exposure High physiological concentrations of Aβ monomer induced angiogenesis by a conserved mechanism that blocks γ-secretase processing of a Notch intermediate, NEXT, and reduces the expression of downstream Notch target genes.  Our findings allude to an integration of signaling pathways that utilize γ-secretase activity, which may have significant implications for our understanding of Alzheimer's pathogenesis vis-à-vis vascular changes that set the stage for ensuing neurodegeneration.  Aggregated forms of Aβ have a pathogenic role in Alzheimer disease and, thus, reducing the Aβ levels by inhibiting γ-secretase is a possible treatment strategy for Alzheimer disease.  Regrettably, clinical trials have shown that inhibition of γ-secretase results in Notch-related side effects.  Therefore, it is of great importance to find ways to inhibit amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing without disturbing vital signaling pathways such as Notch.

###question: Is there any research that relates the function of Notch Signaling with Alzheimer Disease?[EOC] [SOR]###response: Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway, which is fundamental for neuronal development and specification.  In the last decade, increasing evidence has pointed out an important role of this pathway beyond embryonic development, indicating that Notch also displays a critical function in the mature brain of vertebrates and invertebrates.  This pathway appears to be involved in neural progenitor regulation, neuronal connectivity, synaptic plasticity and learning/memory.  In addition, Notch appears to be aberrantly regulated in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and ischemic injury[EOR]"

"[SOC]###context: Of 802 patients treated for craniosynostosis, 28 were identified with Pfeiffer syndrome: 17 were classified as type I (61 percent), seven were classified as type II (25 percent), and four were classified as type III (14 percent).   Pfeiffer syndrome is divided into three clinical subtypes.  Type 1 ""classic"" Pfeiffer syndrome involves individuals with mild manifestations including brachycephaly, midface hypoplasia and finger and toe abnormalities; it is associated with normal intelligence and generally good outcome.  Type 2 consists of cloverleaf skull, extreme proptosis, finger and toe abnormalities, elbow ankylosis or synostosis, developmental delay and neurological complications.  Type 3 is similar to type 2 but without a cloverleaf skull.   Recently, based on clinical findings, the disorder has been divided into three subtypes: type 1, characterized by mild expression; type 2, in which clover leaf skull deformity and multiple congenital anomalies are present at birth; and type 3, which is similar to type 2, but lacks the presence of the clover leaf skull at birth.   It is a clinically variable disorder and has been divided into three subtypes [Cohen, 1993: Am J Med Genet 45:300-307].  Type 1 represents the less severe cases, while types 2 and 3 are the more severe cases.  These latter types tend to have a higher risk for neurodevelopmental problems and a reduced life expectancy.  Classic Pfeiffer syndrome is designated type I.  Type 2 consists of cloverleaf skull with Pfeiffer hands and feet together with ankylosis of the elbows.  Such patients do poorly with an early death.  All reported instances to date have been sporadic.  Type 3 is similar to type 2 but without cloverleaf skull.  Ocular proptosis is severe in degree and the anterior cranial base is markedly short.  These patients also do poorly and tend to have an early death.  To date all cases have occurred sporadically.  Although these 3 clinical subtypes do not have status as separate entities, their diagnostic and prognostic implications are important.  Type 1 is commonly associated with normal intelligence, generally good outcome, and can be found dominantly inherited in some families.  Types 2 and 3 generally have severe neurological compromise, poor prognosis, early death, and sporadic occurrence.

"[SOC]###context: protein interactions are becoming increasingly significant as potential drug targets; however, the rational identification of small molecule inhibitors of such interactions remains a challenge.  Pharmacophore modelling is a popular tool for virtual screening of compound libraries, and has previously been successfully applied to the discovery of enzymatic inhibitors.  However, the application of pharmacophore modelling in the field of protein:protein interaction inhibitors has historically been considered more of a challenge and remains limited.  In this review, we explore the interaction mimicry by known inhibitors that originate from in vitro screening, demonstrating the validity of pharmacophore mapping in the generation of queries for virtual screening.  We discuss the pharmacophore mapping methods that have been successfully employed in the discovery of first-in-class inhibitors.    a popular tool for virtual screening of libraries to identify novel active substances that can be potentially developed into drugs.  While they have been applied for years on common drug targets, their application in the discovery of protein-protein interaction inhibitors remains limited.  This review describes current pharmacophore modelling methods applied in the discovery of novel inhibitors targeting protein-protein interactions.  We first address the mimicry of protein-protein interactions with their respective inhibitors as observed in crystal structure complexes.  This mimicry can be exploited to derive a pharmacophore query from protein-protein complex structures.  We then discuss several cases where pharmacophore queries were utilized for the discovery of first-in-class inhibitors of their respective protein-protein interaction targets.  The best HypoGen pharmacophore model for ACC2 inhibitors (Hypo1_ACC2) consists of one hydrogen bond acceptor, one hydrophobic aliphatic and one hydrophobic aromatic feature, whereas the best pharmacophore (Hypo1_ACC1) for ACC1 consists of one additional hydrogen-bond donor (HBD) features.  The best pharmacophore hypotheses were validated by various methods such as test set, decoy set and Cat-Scramble methodology.  The validated pharmacophore models were used to screen several small-molecule databases, including Specs, NCI, ChemDiv and Natural product databases to identify the potential dual ACC inhibitors.  The virtual hits were then subjected to several filters such as estimated [Formula: see text] value, quantitative estimation of drug-likeness and molecular docking analysis.  pharmacophore model has been developed using diverse classes of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitors useful in the treatment of human tumours.  Among the top 10 generated hypotheses, the second hypothesis, with one hydrogen bond acceptor, one ring aromatic and three hydrophobic features, was found to be the best on the basis of Cat Scramble validation as well as test set prediction (r(training) = 0. 89, r(test) = 0. 82).  The model also maps well to the external test set molecules as well as clinically active molecules and corroborates the docking studies.  Finally, 10 hits were identified as potential leads after virtual screening of ZINC database for EGFR TK inhibition.   In order to clarify the essential structure-activity relationship for the known Aurora-A inhibitors as well as identify new lead compounds against Aurora-A, 3D pharmacophore models were developed based on the known inhibitors.   computational methods for molecular design are well established in medicinal chemistry research, their application in the field of natural products is still not exhaustively explored.  This article gives a short introduction into both the potential for the application of computer-assisted approaches, such as pharmacophore modelling, virtual screening, docking, and neural networking to efficiently access the bioactive metabolites, and the requirements and limitations related to this specific field.  The challenge is which selection criteria and/or multiple filtering tools to apply for a target-oriented isolation of potentially bioactive secondary metabolites.  Application examples are provided where in silico tools and classical methods used by natural product scientists are used in an effort to maximize their efficacy in drug discovery.   pharmacophore models derived from protein binding site atoms without the inclusion of any ligand information have become more popular in virtual screening studies.  However, the accuracy of protein-based pharmacophore models for reproducing the critical protein-ligand interactions has never been explicitly assessed.   Our results demonstrate that there are significant variations in the success of protein-based pharmacophore models to reproduce native contacts and consequently native ligand poses dependent on the details of the pharmacophore generation process.  We show that the generation of optimized protein-based pharmacophore models is a promising approach for ligand pose prediction and pose rankings pharmacophore model does not describe a real molecule or a real association of functional groups but illustrates a molecular recognition of a biological target shared by a group of compounds.  Pharmacophores also represent the spatial arrangement of essential interactions in a receptor-binding pocket.  Structure based pharmacophores (SBPs) can work both with a free (apo) structure or a macromolecule-ligand complex (holo) structure.  The SBP methods that derive pharmacophore from protein-ligand complexes use the potential interactions observed between ligand and protein, whereas, the SBP method that aims to derive pharmacophore from ligand free protein, uses only protein active site information 3D pharmacophore methods are now commonly used as part of more complex workflows in drug discovery campaigns, and have been successfully and extensively applied in virtual screening (VS) approaches.  
###question: Which are the main methods for pharmacophore modelling?[EOC] [SOR]###response: A pharmacophore describes the arrangement of molecular features a ligand must contain to efficaciously bind a receptor.  Pharmacophore models are developed to improve molecular understanding of ligand–protein interactions, and can be used as a tool to identify novel compounds that fulfil the pharmacophore requirements and have a high probability of being biologically active.  Protein structure-based pharmacophores (SBPs) derive these molecular features by conversion of protein properties to reciprocal ligand space.  Unlike ligand-based pharmacophore models, which require templates of ligands in their bioactive conformation, SBPs do not depend on ligand information. [EOR]"
"[SOC]###context: under conditions of nutritional stress, the processing of deaminated bases in B.  subtilis may normally occur in an error-prone manner to promote adaptive mutagenesis.  the B.  subtilis' ability to accumulate chromosomal mutations under conditions of starvation is influenced by cell differentiation and transcriptional derepression, as well as by proteins homologous to transcription and repair factors.  the loss of Mfd has a depressive effect on stationary-phase mutagenesis.  In Bacillus subtilis, transcription-associated mutagenesis has been shown to be independent of recombination-dependent repair and, in some cases, of the Y DNA polymerases.  Central to stationary-phase mutagenesis in B.  subtilis is the requirement for Mfd, transcription coupling repair factor Oxidative stress-induced DNA damage has been associated with generation of adaptive His(+) and Met(+) but not Leu(+) revertants in strain Bacillus subtilis YB955 an interplay between MutY and MutSL (mismatch repair system [MMR]) plays a pivotal role in the production of adaptive Leu(+) revertants.  MMR regulation of the mutagenic/antimutagenic properties of MutY promotes stationary-phase mutagenesis in B.  subtilis cells.  To further examine the correlation between transcription and adaptive mutation, we placed a point-mutated allele, leuC427, under the control of an inducible promoter and assayed the level of reversion to leucine prototrophy under conditions of leucine starvation.  Our results demonstrate that the level of Leu(+) reversions increased significantly in parallel with the induced increase in transcription levels.  a Bacillus subtilis strain deficient in mismatch repair (MMR; encoded by the mutSL operon) promoted the production of stationary-phase-induced mutations starved B.  subtilis cells lacking a functional error prevention GO (8-oxo-G) system (composed of YtkD, MutM, and YfhQ) had a dramatic propensity to increase the number of stationary-phase-induced revertants.  the occurrence of mutations is exacerbated by reactive oxygen species in nondividing cells of B.  subtilis having an inactive GO system.  the absence or depression of both the MMR and GO systems contributes to the production of stationary-phase mutants in B.  subtilis.  oxidative stress is a mechanism that generates genetic diversity in starved cells of B.  subtilis, promoting stationary-phase-induced mutagenesis in this soil microorganism this type of mutagenesis is subject to regulation involving at least two of the genes that are involved in the regulation of post-exponential phase prokaryotic differentiation, i. e. , comA and comK.  a functional RecA protein was not required for this type of mutagenesis.

In conclusion, our results support the idea that oxidative stress is a mechanism that generates genetic diversity in starved cells of B.  subtilis, promoting stationary-phase-induced mutagenesis in this soil microorganism.  Previous studies showed that a Bacillus subtilis strain deficient in mismatch repair (MMR; encoded by the mutSL operon) promoted the production of stationary-phase-induced mutations.  subtilis can be generated through a novel mechanism mediated by error-prone processing of AP sites accumulated in the stationary phase by the PolX DNA polymerase
###question: Which mechanisms underlie adaptive mutagenesis (stationary-phase mutagenesis) in Bacillus subtilis?[EOC] [SOR]###response: Increased transcription levels potentiate adaptive mutagenesis.  Central to stationary-phase mutagenesis in B.  subtilis is the requirement for Mfd protein (transcription repair coupling factor).  The B.  subtilis' ability to accumulate chromosomal mutations under conditions of starvation is influenced by cell differentiation and transcriptional derepression, as well as by proteins homologous to transcription and repair factors.  Under conditions of nutritional stress, the processing of deaminated bases in B.  subtilis may normally occur in an error-prone manner to promote adaptive mutagenesis.  A functional RecA protein is not required for adaptive mutagenesis, which seems to be independent of recombination-dependent repair and, in some cases, of the Y DNA polymerases.  Oxidative stress-induced DNA damage has been associated with adaptive mutagenesis.  The occurrence of such mutations is exacerbated by reactive oxygen species.  Starved B.  subtilis cells lacking a functional error prevention GO (8-oxo-G) system (composed of YtkD, MutM, and YfhQ) had a dramatic propensity to increase the number of stationary-phase-induced revertants.  The MMR (encoded by the mutSL operon) protects B.  subtilis from stationary-phase mutations.  The MMR modulation of the mutagenic/antimutagenic properties of MutY regulates stationary-phase mutagenesis.  Two of the genes that are involved in the regulation of post-exponential phase prokaryotic differentiation, comA and comK, are involved in adaptive mutagenesis.  Also, YqjH, a homolog of DinB protein, plays a role in stationary phase mutagenesis. [EOR]"

The diagnosis of steroid-5-alpha-reductase deficiency is rarely considered by the paediatrician.   n 46,XY disorders of sex development, 5α-reductase deficiency is rare and is not usually the first-intention diagnosis in newborn ambiguous genitalia, contrary to partial androgen insensitivity syndrome.  Yet the cause of ambiguous genitalia may guide sex assignment, and rapid, precise diagnosis of 5α-reductase deficiency is essential Our data clearly demonstrate that 5α-reductase deficiency should be considered in XY adolescents with primary amenorrhea and no breast development associated with virilization at puberty and high plasma T.  Positive parental consanguinity should reinforce the diagnostic orientation.  Molecular diagnosis of 5α-reductase deficiency in 4 elite young female athletes through hormonal screening for hyperandrogenism.  The hormonal analysis evidenced plasma T within the male range, the karyotype was 46, XY, and molecular analysis of the 5α-reductase type 2 (srd5A2) gene identified a homozygotic mutation in 2 cases, a heterozygotic compound in 1 case, and a deletion in 1 case.  5α-Reductase deficiency should be investigated in elite young female athletes with primary amenorrhea and high male T levels detected during antidoping programs to identify undiagnosed XY DSD.  Few studies exist on the psychosexual outcome of homogeneous groups of individuals with 5α-reductase deficiency type 2 (5α-RD-2) and the relation between gender changes and parental hostile and benevolent sexism, which are two components of ambivalent sexism that assume a stereotypical approach toward women in an overtly negative way or a chivalrous, seemingly positive way The high prevalence of gender change and gender dysphoria reported in the literature was confirmed in this relatively large and homogeneous sample of Iranians with 5-α-RD-2 raised as female.  Male pseudo hermaphroditism caused by steroid 5 alpha reductase deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder.  [Male pseudo-hermaphroditism due to partial 5 alpha-reductase deficiency, a case report].  We report two cases of male pseudohermaphroditism, a true hermaphroditism and a 5-alfa-reductase deficiency.  Contrary to what is observed in true hermaphroditism and in male pseudo-hermaphroditism, there is no erroneous transmission of the genetic gonadal differentiation programme in female pseudohermaphroditism.  To our knowledge neither the A49T nor the L113V mutation has been previously reported in association with 5alpha-reductase type 2 deficiency and to date they have only been identified in cases of isolated hypospadias.  The deficiency of steroid 5 alpha-reductase leads to the disturbances in sex differentiation that cause symptoms of male pseudohermaphroditism.  Male pseudohermaphroditism caused by steroid 5alpha-reductase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder.  This study reveals that 5 alpha-reductase deficiency occurs with a frequency of 13 per cent as a cause of male pseudohermaphroditism in the Dominican Republic with approximately the same frequency as XO/XY gonadal dysgenesis.  Deletion of steroid 5 alpha-reductase 2 gene in male pseudohermaphroditism.  In 5 of 33 male pseudohermaphrodites with a normal testosterone response to human chorionic gonadotropin 5 alpha-reductase deficiency was suspected by elevated plasma testosterone/dihydrotestosterone ratios before and/or after human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation.  A deletion in this gene is present in two related individuals with male pseudohermaphroditism caused by 5 alpha-reductase deficiency.  Steroid 5-alpha-reductase 2 deficiency is a rare disorder leading to male pseudohermaphroditism, a condition characterized by incomplete differentiation of male genitalia in 46,XY patients.  The present report describes a cluster of eight patients with male pseudohermaphroditism from a large pedigree with steroid 5 alpha-reductase 2 deficiency (5 alpha RD), who reside in Southern Lebanon.  Inherited deficiencies of 5 alpha-reductase type 2 result in a form of male pseudohermaphroditism in which the external genitalia fail to develop normally.

It was Galen who added the disturbance of function (functio laesa) as the fifth cardinal sign of inflammation to the four well-known cardinal signs of Celsus (rubor, calor, tumor, dolor).  Tumor, calor, rubor, and dolor describe four cardinal signs of inflammation.

"[SOC]###context: Mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to and inactivates interleukin-5, has been shown to reduce asthma exacerbations in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma.   Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose, or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks.   Among developing therapies, biologics designed to block certain pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-5 (mepolizumab) and IL-13 (lebrikizumab), have a greater chance of being used in the clinic.  Imatinib and mepolizumab, a humanized anti-interleukin 5 monoclonal antibody, may be useful in patients with eosinophilic myositis as part of a hypereosinophilic syndrome.   Recent results of the treatment of idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) with the anti-interleukin 5 monoclonal antibody mepolizumab showed its efficacy and manageable safety profile.   Individuals also received a segmental bronchoprovocation with allergen (SBP-Ag) 1 month before and after administering a single dose of mepolizumab (anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody) to reduce airway EOS.   For example, patients with the hypereosinophilic syndrome have received mepolizumab, an anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody, for as long as 6 years and have not developed any characteristic set of adverse events.   Efficacy of anti-interleukin-5 therapy with mepolizumab in patients with asthma: a meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials.  Previous clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab, a monoclonal antibody against IL-5, in patients with asthma.  In this large (616 patients), double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of mepolizumab (a monoclonal antibody that blocks IL-5 binding to its receptor), patients were given placebo, 75-, 250- or 750-mg mepolizumab by intravenous infusion every 4 weeks for 1 year.   BACKGROUND: We examined levels of hyaluronan, a matrix glycosaminoglycan and versican, a matrix proteoglycan, in the sputum of asthmatics treated with mepolizumab (anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody) versus placebo to evaluate the utility of these measurements as possible biomarkers of asthma control and airway remodeling.   Mepolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks binding of the key cytokine implicated specifically in eosinophil maturation and survival, interleukin-5, to its receptor.  Early studies suggest that inhibition of eosinophilic airway inflammation with mepolizumab-a monoclonal antibody against interleukin 5-is associated with a reduced risk of exacerbations.   IL-5 antagonist therapies in current development include two monoclonal anti-IL-5 antibodies (mepolizumab, reslizumab), a monoclonal antibody directed at the IL-5 receptor (benralizumab), and anti-sense oligonucleotide therapy (TPI ASM8).   Two monoclonal antibodies have been designed to neutralize IL-5 (mepolizumab and reslizumab).   To date, two humanized monoclonal antibodies, mepolizumab and reslizumab, have been developed that bind to human IL-5.   Mepolizumab (Bosatria(®), GlaxoSmithKline) is a biologic agent developed to treat asthma.  It represents a humanized monoclonal antibody of IgG1 κ type, which targets human IL-5 and thus prevents its interaction with the α-chain of the IL-5 receptor.  There has been a variable effect with the leukotriene receptor antagonist montelukast and promising early results with mepolizumab, a monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5.   Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mepolizumab, an anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody.  Mepolizumab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1/κ) targeting human interleukin-5 (IL-5), a key haematopoietin needed for eosinophil development and function.  Mepolizumab blocks human IL-5 from binding to the α-chain of the IL-5 receptor complex on the eosinophil cell surface, thereby inhibiting IL-5 signalling.   Recently, encouraging results of treatment with monoclonal antibody neutralizing IL-5, mepolizumab, have been published.  This manuscript reviews the available treatments for HES and the range of side-effects associated with long-term corticosteroid use, and then focuses on the anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibodies, mepolizumab and reslizumab.   The therapeutic progress is primarily due to an explosion of biological therapies, particularly four of them very useful for internists (in an off label use) : Interleukin 1 inhibitors (anakinra, Canakinumab) to treat some auto inflammatory diseases (cryopirin associated periodic syndromes and deficency of interleukin 1 receptor antagonist), monoclonal antibody against interleukin 5 (mepolizumab) to treat some hypereosinophilic syndromes and Churg and Strauss angiitis, interleukin 6 inhibitiors to treat multifocal Castleman's disease and adult Still disease, a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (Bevacizumab) to treat hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.   Besides steroid therapy, the anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody mepolizumab is considered as a target therapy for L-HES.  Mepolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) with potent IL-5 neutralizing effects that represents a potential treatment for eosinophilic diseases.  Anti-interleukin-5 antibody treatment (mepolizumab) in active eosinophilic oesophagitis: a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial.  The pharmacodynamic effect of mepolizumab (a humanised anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody) in EoO was evaluated.  We studied the prednisone-sparing effect of mepolizumab, a monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, in a rare subgroup of patients who have sputum eosinophilia and airway symptoms despite continued treatment with prednisone.   Subjects received infusions of either mepolizumab, an anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody (29 subjects), or placebo (32) at monthly intervals for 1 year.   A recent study showed that a monoclonal antibody to IL-5, mepolizumab, reduced glucocorticoid therapy in HES patients who did not possess the FIP1L1-PDGFRA mutation while controlling eosinophilia and preventing recurrence or progression of tissue damage.   METHODS: We conducted an international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of an anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody, mepolizumab, in patients with the hypereosinophilic syndrome.  Mepolizumab: 240563, anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody - GlaxoSmithKline, anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody - GlaxoSmithKline, SB 240563.  Mepolizumab is an anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody that is in clinical trials with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) for the treatment of severe asthma, nasal polyposis and hypereosinophilic syndrome and eosinophilic oesophagitis (the latter two indications are classed as eosinophilia in the phase table).   A previous small dose-finding study found that mepolizumab, a humanized anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody, had no effect on allergen challenge in humans.  No effect of anti-interleukin-5 therapy (mepolizumab) on the atopy patch test in atopic dermatitis patients.  Mepolizumab is a monoclonal antibody to interleukin-5, which reduces peripheral blood eosinophils.  Previously, we reported that mepolizumab treatment did not result in clinical improvement in AD.   Mepolizumab, an anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody, currently being evaluated, seems promising.   These include imatinib mesylate, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and more recently, mepolizumab, an anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody.   Anti-IL-5 recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody (mepolizumab) for the treatment of atopic dermatitis.  A monoclonal antibody to human interleukin-5 (mepolizumab) was developed for atopic diseases.   Anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody (mepolizumab) reduces baseline bronchial mucosal eosinophils and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins in the reticular basement membrane in mild asthma.   Skin biopsies were performed in 24 atopic subjects at allergen- and diluent-injected sites before 6 and 48 h after, three infusions of a humanized, monoclonal antibody against IL-5 (mepolizumab) using a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled design.   OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of a humanized blocking monoclonal antibody against IL-5 (mepolizumab) in patients with several forms of hyper-eosinophilic syndromes.   Anti-interleukin-5 (mepolizumab) therapy for hypereosinophilic syndromes.  Bronchial biopsies were obtained before and after three infusions of a humanized, anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody (mepolizumab) in 24 atopic asthmatics in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.   GlaxoSmithKline (formerly SmithKline Beecham) is developing mepolizumab (SB-240563), a monoclonal antibody directed against IL-5, as a potential treatment for asthma and atopic dermatitis.  METHODS: Blood, bone marrow, and airway mucosal biopsy specimens were examined before and after anti-IL-5 (mepolizumab) treatment of asthmatic individuals in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.  Anti-IL-5 (mepolizumab) therapy induces bone marrow eosinophil maturational arrest and decreases eosinophil progenitors in the bronchial mucosa of atopic asthmatics.  The role of eosinophils as effector cells in asthma pathogenesis has been questioned since an anti-interleukin (IL)-5 monoclonal antibody (mepolizumab), which depleted blood and sputum eosinophils, failed to inhibit allergen-induced bronchoconstriction and airway hyperresponsiveness.   Mepolizumab (SB-240563), a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for human IL-5, is currently in clinical trials for treatment of asthma.  CONCLUSION: These studies demonstrate that chronic antagonism of IL-5 by mepolizumab in monkeys is safe and has the potential, through long-term reductions in circulating and tissue-resident eosinophils, to be beneficial therapy for chronic inflammatory respiratory diseases.

"[SOC]###context: The histidine-rich Ca-binding protein (HRC) is a Ca-storage protein in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum.  Recent transgenic studies revealed that this protein inhibits the maximal rates of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-transport, leading to cardiac dysfunction.  In view of the role of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-cycling in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, we designed this study to gain further insight into the role of HRC during ischemia/reperfusion.  Our findings suggest that increased cardiac HRC expression protects against ischemia/reperfusion injury in the heart, resulting in improved recovery of function and reduced infarction.  The histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) Ser96Ala polymorphism was shown to correlate with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death only in dilated cardiomyopathy patients The HRC(S96A) mutant exacerbated the inhibitory effects of HRC(WT) on the amplitude of Ca(2+) transients, prolongation of Ca(2+) decay time, and caffeine-induced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release.  Consistent with these findings, HRC(S96A) reduced maximal sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium uptake rate to a higher extent than HRC(WT).  Furthermore, the frequency of spontaneous Ca(2+) sparks, which was reduced by HRC(WT), was increased by mutant HRC(S96A) under resting conditions although there were no spontaneous Ca(2+) waves under stress conditions.  However, expression of the HRC(S96A) genetic variant in cardiomyocytes from a rat model of postmyocardial infarction heart failure induced dramatic disturbances of rhythmic Ca(2+) transients.  These findings indicate that the HRC Ser96Ala variant increases the propensity of arrhythmogenic Ca(2+) waves in the stressed failing heart, suggesting a link between this genetic variant and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in human carriers.

"[SOC]###context: However, apart from the beneficial effects of 800 IU/d of vitamin D3 for reduction of falls in the elderly, causality remains yet unproven in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).   The rate of falls and the number of fallers was significantly reduced in two studies evaluating the effect of medication on preventing falls; one study (85 participants) compared vitamin D versus placebo in institutionalised women after stroke with low vitamin D levels, and the other study (79 participants) evaluated alendronate versus alphacalcidol in hospitalised people after stroke.  Two studies testing vitamin D versus placebo and alendronate versus alphacalcidol found a significant reduction in falls and the number of people falling . Overall, vitamin D supplementation does not appear to reduce falls but may be effective in people who have lower vitamin D levels before treatment.  Overall, vitamin D did not reduce rate of falls (RaR 1. 00, 95% CI 0. 90 to 1. 11; seven trials; 9324 participants) or risk of falling (RR 0. 96, 95% CI 0. 89 to 1. 03; 13 trials; 26,747 participants), but may do so in people with lower vitamin D levels before treatment.  Vitamin D affects bone and muscle health and likely reduces the risk of falls in the elderly.  We found 26 eligible trials of moderate quality that enrolled 45,782 participants, the majority of which were elderly and female.  Vitamin D use was associated with statistically significant reduction in the risk of falls (odds ratio for suffering at least one fall, 0. 86; 95% confidence interval, 0. 77-0. 96) This effect was more prominent in patients who were vitamin D deficient at baseline and in studies in which calcium was coadministered with vitamin D.  Vitamin D combined with calcium reduces the risk of falls.  The majority of the evidence is derived from trials enrolling elderly women.  Studies of vitamin D and calcium for fracture prevention have produced inconsistent results, as a result of different vitamin D status and calcium intake at baseline, different doses and poor to adequate compliance.  Despite significant increases in the provision of hip protectors and use of vitamin D supplementation in both intervention and control facilities, there was no difference in the number of falls or falls injuries between the intervention and control groups, nor a reduction in falls overall.  Beyond fall and fracture prevention, vitamin D may also reduce overall morbidity by multiple mechanisms.   There is evidence to suggest that these agents may reduce the incidence of nonvertebral fractures and falls; however, their benefit on vertebral fracture reduction may depend on the type of active vitamin D.

"[SOC]###context: For efficient genetic transformation, Agrobacterium-mediated as well as direct delivery methods have been used successfully.  However, these methods suffer from many disadvantages especially in terms of transfer of large genes, gene complexes and gene silencing.  To overcome these problems, recently, some efforts have been made to develop genetic transformation systems based on engineered plant chromosomes called minichromosomes or plant artificial chromosomes.   Existing methods for site-directed plasmid mutagenesis are restrained by the small spectrum of modifications that can be introduced by mutagenic primers and the amplicon size limitations of in vitro DNA synthesis.  As demonstrated here, the combined use of Red/ET recombination and unique restriction site elimination enables extensive manipulation regardless of plasmid size and DNA sequence elements.  Bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) derived from genomes of large DNA viruses are powerful tools for functional delineation of viral genes.  Here, we describe a novel method for cloning the genomes of large DNA viruses as BACs, which entails direct in vitro transposition of viral genomes with a BAC cassette, and subsequent recovery in Escherichia coli.  Determination of insertion sites and adjacent viral sequences identify the BAC clones for genetic manipulation and functional characterization.  Here, we describe a vector system for efficient multigene assembly and transformation.  The system consists of a transformation-competent artificial chromosome (TAC)-based acceptor vector together with two donor vectors.  By exploiting the CreloxP recombination system and homing endonucleases, multiple rounds of gene assembly cycling were carried out with alternate use of the donor vectors, and multiple genes were sequentially delivered into the TAC vector. 
###question: List the existing methods for genetic manipulation of cells. [EOC] [SOR]###response: Genetic engineering, also called genetic modification, is the direct manipulation of an organism's genome using biotechnology.  New DNA may be inserted in the host genome by first isolating and copying the genetic material of interest using molecular cloning methods to generate a DNA sequence, or by synthesizing the DNA, and then inserting this construct into the host organism.  Genes may be removed, or ""knocked out"", using a nuclease.  Gene targeting is a different technique that uses homologous recombination to change an endogenous gene, and can be used to delete a gene, remove exons, add a gene, or introduce point mutations.

It is important to identify what proteins are substrates of proteases and where their cleavage sites are so as to reveal the molecular mechanisms and specificity of signaling.  analysis of N- terminomics data generated by terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (TAILS) enables high confidence peptide to protein assignment, protein N-terminal characterization and annotation, and for protease analysis readily allows protease substrate discovery with high confidence.  Several approaches to studying proteolytic activity as it relates to biology, pathophysiology, and drug therapy have been published, including the recently described terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (TAILS) strategy by Kleifeld and colleagues  The degradomics screen terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (TAILS), which enriches for neo-N-terminal peptides of cleaved substrates, was used to identify 58 new native substrates in fibroblast secretomes after incubation with MT6-MMP.    Here we present in detail the steps required to perform our recently described approach we call Terminal Amine Isotopic Labeling of Substrates (TAILS), a combined N-terminomics and protease substrate discovery degradomics platform for the simultaneous quantitative and global analysis of the N-terminome and proteolysis in one MS/MS experiment.   Identification of proteolytic products and natural protein N-termini by Terminal Amine Isotopic Labeling of Substrates (TAILS).   Incorporating iTRAQ whole protein labeling with terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (iTRAQ-TAILS) to enrich the N-terminome by negative selection of the blocked mature original N-termini and neo-N-termini has many advantages.

"[SOC]###context: The dimer formed by the ATF-2 and c-Jun transcription factors is one of the main components of the human interferon-beta enhanceosome.  The induction of IFN transcription resulted from the activation of the components of the IFN-beta enhanceosome, i. e.  IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 3, nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, activating transcription factor (ATF)-2 and c-Jun.  Transcriptional activation of the interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene requires assembly of an enhanceosome containing the transcription factors ATF-2/c-Jun, IRF-3/IRF-7, NF-kappaB and HMGI(Y).  These factors cooperatively bind a composite DNA site and activate expression of the IFN-beta gene.  Here we report that within the IFN-beta enhanceosome the ATF-2-c-jun heterodimer binds in a specific orientation, which is required for assembly of a complex between ATF-2-c-jun and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3).   Here, we identified a small molecule that induces the assembly of the interferon-beta (IFN-beta) enhanceosome by stimulating all the enhancer-binding activator proteins: ATF2/c-JUN, IRF3, and p50/p65 of NF-kappaB.  Transcriptional activation of the virus inducible enhancer of the human interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene in response to virus infection requires the assembly of an enhanceosome, consisting of the transcriptional activators NF-kappaB, ATF-2/c-Jun, IRFs and the architectural protein of the mammalian high mobility group I(Y) [HMG I(Y)].  Here, we demonstrate that the first step in enhanceosome assembly, i. e.  HMG I(Y)-dependent recruitment of NF-kappaB and ATF-2/c-Jun to the enhancer, is facilitated by discrete regions of HMG I and is mediated by allosteric changes induced in the DNA by HMG I(Y) and not by protein-protein interactions between HMG I(Y) and these proteins.  However, we show that completion of the enhanceosome assembly process requires protein-protein interactions between HMG I(Y) and the activators.  Transcriptional activation of the human interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene by virus infection requires the assembly of a higher order nucleoprotein complex, the enhanceosome, which consists of the transcriptional activators NF-kappa B (p50/p65), ATF-2/c-jun, IRF-3 and IRF-7, architectural protein HMGI(Y), and the coactivators p300 and CBP.   The transcriptional coactivators CBP and P/CAF are required for activation of transcription from the IFN beta enhanceosome.  We show that CBP and P/CAF acetylate HMG I(Y), the essential architectural component required for enhanceosome assembly, at distinct lysine residues, causing distinct effects on transcription.  The transcriptional activity of an in vitro assembled human interferon-beta gene enhanceosome is highly synergistic.  This synergy requires five distinct transcriptional activator proteins (ATF2/c-JUN, interferon regulatory factor 1, and p50/p65 of NF-kappaB), the high mobility group protein HMG I(Y), and the correct alignment of protein-binding sites on the face of the DNA double helix.  In addition, we provide evidence that recruitment of the holoenzyme by the enhanceosome is due, at least in part, to interactions between the enhanceosome and the transcriptional coactivator CREB, cAMP responsive element binding protein (CBP).   Transcriptional activation of the IFN beta gene in response to virus infection requires the assembly of an enhanceosome, consisting of the transcriptional activators NF-kappa B, IRF1, ATF2/c-Jun, and the architectural protein HMG I(Y).  Transcriptional synergy requires recruitment of the CBP/p300 coactivator to the enhanceosome, via a new activating surface assembled from the novel p65 domain and the activation domains of all of the activators.  A functional interferon-beta gene enhanceosome was assembled in vitro using the purified recombinant transcriptional activator proteins ATF2/c-JUN, IRF1, and p50/p65 of NF-kappa B.  Maximal levels of transcriptional synergy between these activators required the specific interactions with the architectural protein HMG I(Y) and the correct helical phasing of the binding sites of these proteins on the DNA helix.  We present evidence that transcriptional activation of the human interferon-beta (IFN beta) gene requires the assembly of a higher order transcription enhancer complex (enhanceosome).  This multicomponent complex includes at least three distinct transcription factors and the high mobility group protein HMG I(Y).  Thus, HMG I(Y) plays an essential role in the assembly and function of the IFN beta gene enhanceosome.  Transcriptional activation of the interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene requires assembly of an enhanceosome containing the transcription factors ATF-2/c-Jun, IRF-3/IRF-7, NF-kappaB and HMGI(Y).

"[SOC]###context: The current study explores the incidence and content of dreaming during short-term sedation with sevoflurane or propofo Propofol is the sedative most frequently used for short-term sedation and the weaning phase, whereas benzodiazepines are the preferred substances for medium- and long-term sedation.  Performance of the A-line Autoregressive Index (AAI) and of the Bispectral Index (BIS) at assessing depth of short-term sedation following cardiac surgery.  All patients received sedation with propofol according to the study protocol.  Short-term sedation with either sevoflurane using ACD or propofol did not negatively affect renal function postoperatively.  Assessing feasibility and physiological effects of sedation with sevoflurane, administered with the anesthetic conserving device (AnaConDa), in comparison with propofol and remifentanil.  Sevoflurane can be effectively and safely used for short-term sedation of ICU patients with stable hemodynamic conditions.  Propofol was used for most of the patients during short-term sedation (57%) and during weaning (48%).

This prospective, clinical trial evaluated the effects of short-term propofol administration on triglyceride levels and serum pancreatic enzymes in children undergoing sedation for magnetic resonance imaging.  Dexmedetomidine vs.  propofol for short-term sedation of postoperative mechanically ventilated patients.  The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and endocrine response of propofol vs.  the new alpha2-agonist dexmedetomidine for sedation in surgical intensive care patients who need postoperative short-term ventilation.  A total of 89 adult, nonemergent, coronary artery bypass graft patients with an expected length of intubation of <24 hrs.  METHODS: Patients were randomized to either DEX or propofol The majority of practitioners (82%) use propofol infusion in children in PICU, the main indication being for short-term sedation in children requiring procedures.  Pharmacokinetics and effects of propofol 6% for short-term sedation in paediatric patients following cardiac surgery.  This paper describes the pharmacokinetics and effects of propofol in short-term sedated paediatric patients.  Twenty patients who were expected to require 8 h of post-operative sedation and ventilation were allocated randomly to receive either an infusion of dexmedetomidine 0. 2-2. 5 microg kg(-1) h(-1) or propofol 1-3 mg kg(-1) h(-1) Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propofol 6% SAZN versus propofol 1% SAZN and Diprivan-10 for short-term sedation following coronary artery bypass surgery.  The pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety characteristics of propofol 6% SAZN were investigated during a short-term infusion and compared with the commercially available product propofol 1% in Intralipid 10% (Diprivan-10) and propofol 1% in Lipofundin MCT/LCT 10% (propofol 1% SAZN).  METHODS: In a randomised double-blind study, 24 male patients received a 5-h infusion of propofol at the rate of 1 mg/kg/h for sedation in the immediate postoperative period following coronary artery bypass surgery Propofol infusion and oxycodone-thiopental bolus dosages, titrated to the same sedation end point, resulted in similar time from admission to extubation, although the weaning period was shorter in the propofol group.  In terms of breathing pattern, gas exchange, blood gases and haemodynamics, the methods were similar.  Propofol, despite its attractive pharmacological profile, may offer no clinical benefit in short-term sedation after a moderate dose fentanyl anaesthesia in cardiac surgery.  Postoperative short-term sedation with propofol in cardiac surgery.  We conducted a randomized double-blind study to assess the safety and effectiveness of short-term sedation with propofol in adult patients immediately after cardiac surgery.  The use of propofol for short-term sedation in ICUs has allowed the maintenance of sedation to continue until just a few hours before extubation but the benefits of propofol for longer-term indications are more debatable.  Midazolam and propofol are available as hypnotics for short-term sedation during the post-operative period.

"[SOC]###context: Screening for breast cancer in male-to-female transsexuals should be undertaken for those with additional risk factors (e. g. , family history, BRCA2 mutation, Klinefelter syndrome) and should be available to those who desire screening, preferably in a clinical trial.  Klinefelter syndrome (OR = 24. 7; 95% CI = 8. 94 to 68. 4) and gynecomastia (OR = 9. 78; 95% CI = 7. 52 to 12. 7) were also statistically significantly associated with risk, relations that were independent of BMI.   Male breast cancer risk factors show strong association with BRCA2 mutations, as well as Klinefelter syndrome.   The main risk factors include: the mutation of genes BRCA 1 and 2, Klinefelter's syndrome, alcohol, liver disease, obesity.   Although aetiology is still unclear, constitutional, environmental, hormonal (abnormalities in estrogen/androgen balance) and genetic (positive family history, Klinefelter syndrome, mutations in BRCA1 and specially BRCA2) risk factors are already known.   The largest study found 19. 2- and 57. 8-fold increases in incidence and mortality, respectively, with particularly high risks among 47,XXY mosaics.   CONCLUSIONS: Additional well-designed epidemiologic studies are needed to clarify which patients with KS are at a high risk of developing MBC and to distinguish between possible predisposing factors, including altered endogenous hormones.  Major risk factors for developing male BC include clinical disorders involving hormonal imbalances (excess of estrogen or a deficiency of testosterone as seen in patients with Klinefelter syndrome) and a positive family history for breast cancer.   Patients with 47, XXY karyotype (Klinefelter syndrome) appear to have increased risk of developing cancer, especially male breast cancer, germ cell tumours and non Hodgkin lymphomas, but rarely acute myeloid leukaemia.   Breast cancer in a patient with Klinefelter's syndrome is reported.  The increased conversion of testosterone to estradiol at the therapy with androgens might be responsible for the development of breast cancer in Klinefelter's syndrome.  Patients with a 47,XXY karyotype (Klinefelter syndrome) appear to have an increased risk of developing cancer, especially male breast cancer and germ cell tumors, but rarely malignant hematologic disorders.  The frequencies of diabetes mellitus, breast cancer, and germ cell neoplasia increases in Klinefelter's syndrome.  There is evidence, however, to suggest that Klinefelter's males have an increased risk of breast cancer that approaches three percent.  Klinefelter syndrome has been consistently associated with breast cancer in men (MBC). <br><b>CASE REPORT</b>: We report a 54-year old man was diagnosed as synchronous bilateral breast cancer with Klinefelter syndrome.  These results support a hormonal etiology for breast cancer in men and for prostate cancer and suggest that men with Klinefelter syndrome may be at substantially elevated risks for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, breast cancer, and, perhaps, lung cancer.  Major genetic factors associated with an increased risk of breast cancer for men include BRCA2 mutations, which are believed to account for the majority of inherited breast cancer in men, Klinefelter syndrome, and a positive family history.  Those affected by Klinefelter's syndrome are at increased risk of systemic lupus erythematosus, breast cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and lung cancer.  CONCLUSIONS These results support a hormonal etiology for breast cancer in men and for prostate cancer and suggest that men with Klinefelter syndrome may be at substantially elevated risks for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, breast cancer, and, perhaps, lung cancer.  Compared with the general population, men with Klinefelter syndrome had higher mortality from lung cancer (SMR = 1. 5, 95% CI = 1. 0 to 2. 0), breast cancer (SMR = 57. 8, 95% CI = 18. 8 to 135. 0), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SMR = 3. 5, 95% CI = 1. 6 to 6. 6) and lower mortality from prostate cancer (SMR = 0, 95% CI = 0 to 0. 7).  Klinefelter syndrome has been consistently associated with breast cancer in men (MBC).  Male breast cancer risk factors show strong association with BRCA2 mutations, as well as Klinefelter syndrome.  Patients with 47, XXY karyotype (Klinefelter syndrome) appear to have increased risk of developing cancer, especially male breast cancer, germ cell tumours and non Hodgkin lymphomas, but rarely acute myeloid leukaemia.  Klinefelter syndrome, in which patients carry XXY chromosome, may be present in men with breast cancer for this reason they often develop gynecomastia. <br> Klinefelter syndrome has been consistently associated with breast cancer in men (MBC).

"[SOC]###context: Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) is an autosomal recessive disease with a clinical spectrum ranging from a neurovisceral infantile form (Niemann-Pick disease type A) to a chronic visceral form also encountered in adults (Niemann-Pick disease type B, NP-B) Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMd, Niemann-Pick disease A/B) Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), a rare lysosomal storage disease, is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by different SMPD1 mutations.  Historically, ASMD has been classified as Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) types A (NPD A) and B (NPD B).   Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) deficient Niemann-Pick disease is a lysosomal storage disorder resulting from mutations in the SMPD1 gene.  The clinical spectrum distinguishes a severe infantile neurological form (type A), a non-neurological visceral form (type B) and a rare intermediate neurovisceral form.   BACKGROUND  Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), [Niemann-Pick Disease Types A and B (NPD A and B)], is an inherited metabolic disorder resulting from deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid sphingomyelinase.  Introduction  Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD, also known as Niemann-Pick Type A and Type B disease) is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder.  Historically, ASMD has been classified as Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) types A (NPD A) and B (NPD B).  Niemann-Pick disease (types A and B), or acid sphingomyelinase deficiency, is an inherited deficiency of acid sphingomyelinase, resulting in intralysosomal accumulation of sphingomyelin in cells throughout the body, particularly within those of the reticuloendothelial system.  Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) is an autosomal recessive disease with a clinical spectrum ranging from a neurovisceral infantile form (Niemann-Pick disease type A) to a chronic visceral form also encountered in adults (Niemann-Pick disease type B, NP-B).  Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD, also known as Niemann-Pick Type A and Type B disease) is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder.  Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), due to mutations in the sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1 (SMPD1) gene, is divided into infantile neurovisceral ASMD (Niemann-Pick type A), chronic neurovisceral ASMD (intermediate form, Niemann-Pick type A/B) and chronic visceral ASMD (Niemann-Pick type B).  Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD), [Niemann-Pick Disease Types A and B (NPD A and B)], is an inherited metabolic disorder resulting from deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid sphingomyelinase.

"[SOC]###context: Fanconi anemia (FA) is an autosomal disorder that causes genome instability.  FA patients suffer developmental abnormalities, early-onset bone marrow failure, and a predisposition to cancer.  The disease is manifested by defects in DNA repair, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, and a high degree of chromosomal aberrations.  Fanconi anemia (FA) is characterized at the cellular level by a high frequency of spontaneous chromosomal aberrations; crosslinking agents cause an abnormal increase in the frequency of chromosomal damage, and semiconservative DNA synthesis is severely inhibited.  Features of chromosomal aberrations, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, and predisposition to malignancy have suggested a fundamental anomaly of DNA repair in Fanconi anemia.  Cells from patients wtih Fanconi's anemia are unusually sensitive to agents which are capable of crosslinking DNA.  An elevated frequency of chromosome aberrations, which is further exaggerated by exposure of cells to DNA crosslinking agents, is a general feature of Fanconi's anemia.  FA patients exhibit spontaneous chromosome breakage and FA cells are sensitive to DNA interstrand crosslink agents and expresses high frequency of chromosome breakage Fanconi anemia (FA) is characterized at the cellular level by a high frequency of spontaneous chromosomal aberrations; crosslinking agents cause an abnormal increase in the frequency of chromosomal damage, and semiconservative DNA synthesis is severely inhibited Cells from patients wtih Fanconi's anemia are unusually sensitive to agents which are capable of crosslinking DNA At the cellular level, FA is characterized by hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents and by high frequencies of induced chromosomal aberrations, a property used for diagnosis An elevated frequency of chromosome aberrations, which is further exaggerated by exposure of cells to DNA crosslinking agents, is a general feature of Fanconi's anemia Similarly, Fanconi's anemia cells, which are chromosomally sensitive to crosslinking agents, and appear to be defective in the ""unhooking"" of linked polynucleotide strands [15, 16, 49, 51], are reported to be chromosomally sensitive to ethyl methanesulfonate as well [29], and to be sensitive to ionizing radiation [7, 19, ]0], again implying overlapping repair systems

"[SOC]###context: Fractures of the transverse processes in the lumbar vertebrae occur as the result of major forces such as direct blunt trauma, violent lateral flexion-extension forces, avulsion of the psoas muscle, or Malgaigne fractures of the pelvis.  The anteroposterior radiographic view revealed ununited fractures at the left superior and inferior pubic ramus, noted as a type I Malgaigne fracture.   Posterior urethral injuries occur more commonly with vertically applied forces, which typically create Malgaigne-type fractures.   Patients with bilateral pubic rami fractures or Malgaigne fractures were particularly prone to additional injuries; therefore, abdominal CT examinations are recommended in these patients.  Pelvic fractures, especially those of a Malgaigne type, frequently occur in patients who are polytraumatized.   The authours report the case of a 27-year-old man who had suffered a severe polytrauma with blunt thoracic injury, fracture of the lumbar spine, Malgaigne-type fracture of the pelvis and fracture of the femoral shaft on the right side, 10 years before.  The paper deals with the displacement of the uterus observed during management of Malgaigne type pelvic fracture in a 33 years old female.   This problem was first described by Malgaigne in 1857 in his classic article on double vertical fractures of the pelvis, in which he described a 34-year-old woman with a pelvic fracture who subsequently died during childbirth.  Eleven cases of sacroiliac dislocation and/or fracture (Malgaigne pattern) were successfully reduced and stabilized using two threaded compression rods.  We compared the mechanical performance of the Orthofix pelvic external fixator with that of the Pittsburgh triangular frame (PTF) on eight fresh-frozen cadaver pelves with experimentally created Malgaigne (double-vertical) fracture/dislocations.  A 48-year-old woman developed symptomatic superior and inferior pubic rami fractures with a concomitant subluxation of the ipsilateral sacroiliac joint three years after pelvic irradiation for a gynecologic malignancy.   Twenty-six of the thirty-two cadavera that were examined radiographically and dissected had a double break in the pelvic ring (Malgaigne pattern).   Initial hypotension, Malgaigne and bilateral pubic rami fractures, and blood requirements exceeding 2,000 cc were suggestive of abdominal trauma.    Malgaigne-type fractures with sacroiliac disruptions were created in four cadaver pelvises.   The authors report 7 cases involving the surgical treatment of unstable pelvic ring fractures (Malgaigne type) using two compression bars, as described by Tile.   Malgaigne fracture is referred to pelvic ring disruption at two sites, and is often treated surgically for its instability.   Sacral fractures are generally accompanied by pelvic ring fractures.

"[SOC]###context: Long QT syndrome (LQTS) 1 is the most common type of inherited LQTS and is linked to mutations in the KCNQ1 gene.   This report describes a three-generation family with a severe phenotype of long-QT syndrome-1 (LQTS-1) caused by a single nucleotide mutation in the KQT-like, voltage-gated potassium channel-1 gene (KCNQ1; MIM 607542).  Mutations in a cardiac voltage-gated potassium channel, KCNQ1, account for the most common form of LQTS, LQTS1.   Nine patients were diagnosed with LQT1 and nine with LQT2.  The other six individuals were healthy, with no symptoms characteristic for prolonged QT syndrome, but came from families with confirmed disease occurrence.  The study was conducted on members of four families.  In order to search for mutations (using mSSCP and sequencing), genomic DNA was obtained from patients to determine the expression levels of the genes KCNQ1 and KCNH2 (HERG), involved in the occurrence of clinical signs of disease.  Diagnosis of RWS is established by prolongation of the QTc interval in the absence of specific conditions known to lengthen it (for example, QT-prolonging drugs) and/or molecular genetic testing of the genes known to be associated with RWS, of which KCNQ1 (locus name LQT1), KCNH2 (locus name LQT2) and SCN5A (locus name LQT3) are the most common.  Other, less frequently involved genes are KCNE1 (locus name LQT5), KCNE2 (locus name LQT6), CAV3 (locus name LQT9), SCN4B (locus name LQT10), AKAP9 (locus name LQT11), SNTA1 (locus name LQT12) and KCNJ5 (locus name LQT13).  Type-1 long-QT syndrome (LQT1) is caused by mutations in the KCNQ1 gene.  Congenital LQTS is most frequently caused by mutations in KCNQ1 (Kv7. 1), whereas drug-induced LQTS is a consequence of HERG (human ether-a-go-go-related gene) channel inhibition.   Mutations in the voltage-gated potassium channel subunit KCNQ1 induce the most common form of LQTS.  Genetic studies have identified mutations in six ion channel genes, KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1 and KCNE2 and the accessory protein Ankyrin-B gene, to be responsible for this disorder.   Seven family members were carriers of two amino acid alterations in cis (V254M-V417M) in the cardiac potassium channel gene KCNQ1.   KCNQ1 (formerly called KVLQT1) is a Shaker-like voltage-gated potassium channel gene responsible for the LQT1 sub-type of LQTS.  Five genes have been implicated in Romano-Ward syndrome, the autosomal dominant form of LQTS: KVLQT1, HERG, SCN5A, KCNE1, and KCNE2.  It usually is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait (Romano-Ward syndrome).  The primary defect in LQT1 is a mutation in KVLQT1, a gene that encodes the pore-forming alpha-subunit of a K+ channel.   Romano-Ward syndrome is an autosomal dominant long-QT syndrome (LQTS) that predisposes affected individuals to sudden death from tachyarrhythmias.  We investigated the molecular basis of LQTS in a Taiwanese kindred.  Clinical and genetic analyses revealed that a mutation was linked to the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG).  We describe a Swedish family with the proband and his brother suffering from severe Romano-Ward syndome (RWS) associated with compound heterozygosity for two mutations in the KVLQT1 (also known as KCNQ1 and KCNA9) The cardiac sodium channel gene, SCN5A, is also mutated in some Romano-Ward cases to produce defects in INa, the cardiac inward Na+ current.   These findings provide the first evidence for a recessive form of the Romano-Ward long-QT syndrome and indicate that homozygous mutations on KVLQT1 do not invariably produce the Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome.

"[SOC]###context: To investigate cohesin-non-CTCF (CNC) binding events in vivo we mapped cohesin and CTCF, as well as a collection of tissue-specific and ubiquitous transcriptional regulators using ChIP-seq in primary mouse liver.  In contrast to regions of the genome where cohesin and CTCF colocalize, CNC sites coincide with the binding of master regulators and enhancer-markers and are significantly associated with liver-specific expressed genes.  Here we report that cohesins colocalize with CTCF at two additional imprinted loci, the Dlk1-Dio3 and the Kcnq1/Kcnq1ot1 loci.  By use of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2), we found that liver-specific transcription factors colocalize with cohesin independently of CTCF at liver-specific targets that are distinct from those found in breast cancer cells Because cohesin can colocalize with CTCF, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation for the cohesin subunit Rad21 and found lineage and stage-specific Rad21 recruitment to CTCF in all Ig loci Here we show that zebrafish runx1 is directly bound by cohesin and CCCTC binding factor (CTCF) at the P1 and P2 promoters, and within the intron between P1 and P2.  The intronic binding sites for cohesin and CTCF coincide with histone modifications that confer enhancer-like properties, and two of the cohesin/CTCF sites behaved as insulators in an in vivo assay The identified cohesin and CTCF binding sites are likely to be cis-regulatory elements (CREs) for runx1 since they also recruit RNA polymerase II (RNAPII).  We have found that CTCF and cohesin are highly enriched at the convergent and partially overlapping transcripts for the LMP1 and LMP2A genes, but it is not yet known how CTCF and cohesin may coordinately regulate these transcripts haracterization of constitutive CTCF/cohesin loci: a possible role in establishing topological domains in mammalian genomes Our analysis revealed: 1) constitutive CTCF loci were located in constitutive open chromatin and often co-localized with constitutive cohesin loci In brain, a third of CTCF and cohesin binding sites coincide, consistent with the potential for many interactions between cohesin and CTCF but also many instances of independent action Here, we focus on the emerging roles of CTCF and the cohesin in coordinating long-range interactions between regulatory elements Chromatin immunoprecipitation for CTCF and the cohesin subunits RAD21 and SMC3 reveals evolutionarily conserved binding sites within unmethylated regions ∼5 kb downstream of the PLAGL1 differentially methylated region and within the PLAGL1 3' untranslated region (UTR) TCF physically links cohesin to chromatin ohesin and CTCF: cooperating to control chromosome conformation? Recently, three groups mapped numerous cohesin-binding sites in mammalian chromosomes and found substantial overlap with the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) We found that each site contains a conserved CTCF consensus sequence, binds CTCF, and recruits the cohesin subunit Rad21 in vivo Recent experiments have revealed that cohesin binds to the same sites in mammalian genomes as the zinc finger transcription factor CTCF Here we review what is known about the roles of cohesin and CTCF in regulating gene expression in mammalian cells, and we discuss how cohesin might mediate the insulator function of CTCF Previous studies have shown that this major latency control region is occupied by the cellular chromatin boundary factor CTCF and chromosome structural maintenance proteins SMC1, SMC3, and RAD21, which comprise the cohesin complex Cohesin subunits assembled at the CTCF binding sites and bound CTCF proteins in a cell cycle-dependent manner We propose that the CTCF-cohesin complex plays a critical role in regulating the cell cycle control of viral gene expression during latency and that failure to maintain cell cycle control of latent transcripts inhibits host cell proliferation and survival We used chromosome conformation capture to determine long-range interactions among CTCF/cohesin sites over 2 Mb on human chromosome 11 encompassing the beta-globin locus and flanking olfactory receptor genes These results support a genome-wide role for CTCF/cohesin sites through loop formation that both influences transcription and contributes to cell-type-specific chromatin organization and function Increased methylation at this promoter triggered the dissociation of the insulator protein CTCF as well as the accompanying cohesin from the BDNF locus icotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-regulated DNA methylation alters CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)/cohesin binding and transcription at the BDNF locus ecent studies have shown that the protein CTCF, which plays an important role in insulation and in large-scale organization of chromatin within the eukaryotic nucleus, depends for both activities on recruitment of the cohesin complex We show here that the interaction of CTCF with the cohesin complex involves direct contacts between the cohesin subunit SA2 and specific regions of the C-terminal tail of CTCF Taken together, our results demonstrate that specific sites on the C terminus of CTCF are essential for cohesin binding and insulator function The only direct interaction between CTCF and cohesin involves contact with SA2, which is external to the cohesin ring These numerous CTCF/cohesin sites potentially form the bases of the multiloop rosette structures at the Igh locus that compact during Ig heavy chain rearrangement We have previously shown that the Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus (KSHV) major latency transcripts encoding LANA, vCyclin, vFLIP, v-miRNAs, and Kaposin are regulated, in part, by a chromatin organizing element that binds CTCF and cohesins Mutation of the CTCF-cohesin binding site reduced or eliminated the chromatin conformation linkages, and deregulated viral transcription and genome copy number control Our findings indicate that KSHV genomes are organized into chromatin loops mediated by CTCF and cohesin interactions, and that these inter-chromosomal linkages coordinate latent and lytic gene control.  We show here that GA disrupts an RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) complex that accumulates at the CTCF-cohesin binding site within the first intron of the latency transcript.  GA altered the enrichment of the RNAPII pausing complex, along with pausing factors SPT5 and NELF-A, at the intragenic CTCF-cohesin binding sites.  GA treatment also inhibited the transcription of some cellular genes, like c-myc, which contain a similar CTCF-cohesin binding site within the first intron.  These findings suggest that RNAPII pauses at intragenic CTCF-cohesin binding sites and that abrogation of this pausing by GA leads to loss of proper mRNA production and defects in sister chromatid cohesion, a process important for both viral and cellular chromosome stability.  TCF and cohesin cooperatively mediate the cell-type specific interchromatin interaction between Bcl11b and Arhgap6 loci Additional experiments verified that the interchromatin interaction between the Bcl11b and Arhgap6 loci was cell-type specific, which was cooperatively mediated by CTCF and cohesin.  enome-wide studies of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and cohesin provide insight into chromatin structure and regulation Recent genome-wide studies mapping the binding sites of CTCF and its interacting partner, cohesin, using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealded that CTCF globally co-localizes with cohesin Here, we show by ChIP-Seq that most human subtelomeres contain a CTCF- and cohesin-binding site within ∼1-2 kb of the TTAGGG repeat tract and adjacent to a CpG-islands implicated in TERRA transcription control.  These findings indicate that CTCF and cohesin are integral components of most human subtelomeres, and important for the regulation of TERRA transcription and telomere end protection In addition, we show that this DNA looping requires specific binding of the CTCF/cohesin complex to two symmetrically aligned binding sites in both the transcriptionally active promoters and in one of the enhancers

Additionally, the number of binding sites for radioligands labelling L- ([3H]nitrendipine), N- ([125I]omega-conotoxin MVIIA) and P/Q-type ([125I]omega-conotoxin MVIIC) Ca2+ channels was assessed in the rat retina and, for further comparison, in the rat cortex.  Omega-conotoxin MVIIC (MVIIC) blocks P/Q-type calcium channels with high affinity and N-type calcium channels with low affinity, while the highly homologous omega-conotoxin MVIIA blocks only N-type calcium channels.  However, omega-conotoxin MVIIC seems to bind to sites different from those recognised by omega-conotoxin GVIA and MVIIA, which are markedly differentiated by their Ca2+ requirements for binding to their receptors.  Despite their high sequence homology, the peptide neurotoxins omega-conotoxin MVIIA and MVIIC selectively block N- and P/Q-type calcium channels, respectively.  Replacement of the N-terminal half of omega-conotoxin MVIIC, a peptide blocker of P/Q-type calcium channels, with that of omega-conotoxin MVIIA significantly increased the affinity for N-type calcium channels.   Omega-conotoxin MVIIC (MVIIC) blocks P/Q-type calcium channels with high affinity and N-type calcium channels with low affinity, while the highly homologous omega-conotoxin MVIIA blocks only N-type calcium channels.

We previously implicated missense and splicing-defective THOC2 variants in NDDs and a broad range of other clinical features.  Here we report 10 individuals from nine families with rare missense THOC2 variants including the first case of a recurrent variant (p. Arg77Cys), and an additional individual with an intragenic THOC2 microdeletion (Del-Ex37-38).  Ex vivo missense variant testing and patient-derived cell line data from current and published studies show 9 of the 14 missense THOC2 variants result in reduced protein stability.  The splicing-defective and deletion variants result in a loss of small regions of the C-terminal THOC2 RNA binding domain (RBD).  Interestingly, reduced stability of THOC2 variant proteins has a flow-on effect on the stability of the multi-protein TREX complex; specifically on the other NDD-associated THOC subunits.  Our current, expanded cohort refines the core phenotype of THOC2 NDDs to language disorder and/or ID, with a variable severity, and disorders of growth.

Patients with severe asthma or COPD have often a suboptimal symptom control due to inadequate treatment.   For example, patients with the hypereosinophilic syndrome have received mepolizumab, an anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody, for as long as 6 years and have not developed any characteristic set of adverse events.  Safety data for reslizumab, another anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody, and benralizumab, a monoclonal antibody to the IL-5 receptor α-chain, are comparatively limited, especially for benralizumab, although reports of administration of these antibodies to humans suggest that they are well tolerated.  IL-5 antagonist therapies in current development include two monoclonal anti-IL-5 antibodies (mepolizumab, reslizumab), a monoclonal antibody directed at the IL-5 receptor (benralizumab), and anti-sense oligonucleotide therapy (TPI ASM8).

"[SOC]###context: A novel alpha-tropomyosin mutation associates with dilated and non-compaction cardiomyopathy and diminishes actin binding We show that a mutation in TPM1 is associated with DCM and a lethal, early onset form of NCCM, probably as a result of diminished actin binding caused by weakened charge-charge interactions.  We describe, in two separate autosomal-dominant NCCM families, the identification of mutations in the sarcomeric cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain gene (MYH7), known to be associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), restricted cardiomyopathy (RCM), and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).  These results confirm the genetic heterogeneity of NCCM and suggest that the molecular classification of cardiomyopathies includes an MYH7-associated spectrum of NCCM with HCM, RCM, and DCM.

"[SOC]###context: CPP1 depletion also causes reduced POR accumulation in etioplasts of dark-grown plants and as a result impairs the formation of prolamellar bodies, which subsequently affects chloroplast biogenesis upon illumination.  Prolamellar bodies (PLBs) isolated from etiolated wheat seedlings were studied with the use of atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and fluorescence spectroscopy TEM analyses confirmed that PLBs of wheat leaf etioplasts also had an average diameter of appr.  1μm etioplasts with prolamellar bodies (PLBs) and photoactive, 655nm emitting Pchlide form accumulated primarily in the basal leaf regions after 2 weeks of regeneration.  When these latter leaves were illuminated with continuous light for 3 days, the etioplasts transformed into regular chloroplasts POR complex assembly (including LHPP and POR dimers) did not affect the formation of prolamellar bodies (PLBs) that function for efficient capture of light energy for photo conversion in etioplasts.  Etioplasts that develop in the place of chloroplasts in the dark contain a highly organized lipid structure termed prolamellar body (PLB), which is the main site of accumulation of the ternary Pchlide:POR:NADPH complexes.  During skotomorphogenesis in angiosperms, NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR) forms an aggregate of photolabile NADPH-POR-protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) ternary complexes localized to the prolamellar bodies within etioplasts.  The content of the supramolecular light-harvesting POR complex LHPP (light-harvesting NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase:protochlorophyllide) and the density of prolamellar bodies in etioplasts are decreased in the mutant.  The Arabidopsis porB-1 porC-1 mutant displays a severe xantha (highly chlorophyll-deficient) phenotype characterized by smaller prolamellar bodies in etioplasts The most notable contributions of thin section electron microscopy include the elucidation of the 3-D organization of thylakoid membranes, the discovery of prolamellar bodies in etioplasts This resulted in the recovery of thylakoid membrane stacking in chloroplasts in the light, and the formation of prolamellar bodies and plastoglobuli in etioplasts in the dark.  The prolamellar body (PLB) proteome of dark-grown wheat leaves was characterized.  PLBs are formed not only in etioplasts but also in chloroplasts in young developing leaves during the night A fraction of highly purified prolamellar bodies was isolated from etioplasts of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.  The highest specific activity of the enzyme in etiolated leaf tissue was confirmed to be in the fraction of prolamellar bodies.  This work reveals a new view on the formation of prolamellar bodies and provides new clues about the function of POR in the etioplast-chloroplast transition.  The Arabidopsis porB-1 porC-1 mutant displays a severe xantha (highly chlorophyll-deficient) phenotype characterized by smaller prolamellar bodies in etioplasts and decreased thylakoid stacking in chloroplasts.  Transmission electron microscopy revealed partially developed, agranal plastids in the dark-grown mutant, unlike wild-type seedlings that contain etioplasts with prolamellar bodies.  Organization of protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase in prolamellar bodies isolated from etiolated carotenoid-deficient wheat leaves as revealed by fluorescence probes.  In fully etiolated leaves lamellae are absent and the prolamellar bodies become quite large, presumably because of inhibition of the fusion step which appears to require chlorophyll.  POR is a peripheral membrane protein that accumulates to high levels in the prolamellar bodies of vascular plant etioplasts and is present at low levels in the thylakoid membranes of developing and mature plastids.  This work reveals a new view on the formation of prolamellar bodies and provides new clues about the function of POR in the etioplast-chloroplast transition.  The results presented in this paper are not consistent with the hypothesis that the molar ratio of MGDG/DGDG is responsible for the tubular structure of prolamellar bodies in etioplasts.

"[SOC]###context: Gene loops have been described in different organisms from yeast to human and form through interaction between components of the transcription pre-initiation complex and Ssu72, a member of the 3' end cleavage and polyadenylation complex A large cleavage and polyadenylation complex containing the major poly(A) polymerase Pap1 produces mRNA 3' ends, whereas those of nonpolyadenylated snoRNAs in yeast are formed either by endonucleolytic cleavage or by termination, followed by trimming by the nuclear exosome.  Poly(A) tails are added by Pap1 to both forms, whereas the alternative poly(A) polymerase Tfr4 adenylates major precursors and processing intermediates to facilitate further polyadenylation by Pap1 and maturation by the exosome/Rrp6 A more important role of Trf4/TRAMP, however, is to enhance Nrd1 association with snoRNA genes.  Screening crude natural product extracts with this technology has resulted in the identification of a novel family of antifungal natural products, named the parnafungins, which inhibit the enzyme polyadenosine polymerase (PAP), a key component of the mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation complex.  We show that phosphorylation of TFIIB at serine 65 regulates the interaction between TFIIB and the CstF-64 component of the CstF 3' cleavage and polyadenylation comple We now show that Pcf11, a component of the cleavage and polyadenylation complex (CPAC), is also generally required for NRD-dependent transcription termination through the action of its C-terminal domain (CTD)-interacting domain (CID) Like the yeast counterpart, mammalian Ssu72 associates with TFIIB and the yeast cleavage/polyadenylation factor Pta1, and exhibits intrinsic phosphatase activity.  We also provide evidence that Pti1p probably acts by uncoupling cleavage and polyadenylation, and functions in coordination with the Nrd1p-dependent pathway for 3' end formation of non-polyadenylated transcripts.

"[SOC]###context: CpG island in promoter of hepaCAM gene was hyper-methylated both in bladder carcinoma tissues and cell lines (T24 and BIU-87).  Otherwise, aberrant methylation of its promoter was associated with its decreased expression.  Abnormal hypermethylation in CpG island of hepaCAM promoter is involved in absence of hepaCAM gene expression when bladder cancer occurs.  Methylated RARβ(2) and APC were significantly higher in bladder cancer patients (62. 8%, 59. 5%) than benign (16. 4%, 5%) but not detected in healthy volunteers (0%) at (P < 0. 0001).  Among the 128 patients with bilharzial bladder cancer, 94 (73. 4%) showed methylated RARβ(2) and 86 (67. 2%) showed methylated APC.  Thus, methylated RARβ(2) and APC genes might be valuable urinary molecular markers for early detection of bilharzial and nonbilharzial bladder cancer.  Exon 2 methylation inhibits hepaCAM expression in transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder the expression of hepaCAM was absent in T24 and BIU-87 cells, and we found that exon 2 of hepaCAM was methylated in the 2 cells.  hepaCAM mRNA was re-expressed and the methylation status of hepaCAM exon 2 was reversed after treatment with 5-Aza-CdR.  The methylation rate of hepaCAM exon 2 was significantly higher in bladder cancer tissues than in adjacent tissues.  Recently, methylation of the TPEF (transmembrane protein containing epidermal growth factor and follistatin domain) gene was reported in human colon, gastric, and bladder cancer cells.  Hypermethylation of at least one of three suppressor genes (APC, RASSF1A, and p14(ARF)) was found in all 45 tumor DNAs (100% diagnostic coverage).  Methylation of the CpG island in the promoter of the p16 gene in human bladder cancer cells did not stop the formation of a transcript initiated 20 kb upstream by the p19 promoter but did prevent the expression of a p16 transcript.  We also present the first functional evidence that methylation of only a small number of CpG sites can significantly down-regulate p16 promoter activity, thus providing support for the model of progressive inactivation of this tumor suppressor gene by DNA methylation.  Hypermethylation of hepaCAM gene was reversed and expression of its mRNA and protein were re-activated in two cell lines by DNA methyltransferases inhibitor 5-aza-CdR

"[SOC]###context: Endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) removes improperly-folded proteins from the ER membrane into the cytosol where they undergo proteasomal degradation.   In the secretory pathway, quality control for the correct folding of proteins is largely occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), at the earliest possible stage and in an environment where early folding intermediates mix with terminally misfolded species.  An elaborate cellular mechanism aims at dividing the former from the latter and promotes the selective transport of misfolded species back into the cytosol, a step called retrotranslocation.  During retrotranslocation proteins will become ubiquitinated on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane by dedicated machineries and will be targeted to the proteasome for degradation.  The entire process, from protein recognition to final degradation, has been named ER-associated protein degradation, or simply ERAD.  From the many cellular processes, Cdc48 is involved in, its function in endoplasmic reticulum associated protein degradation (ERAD) is understood best.  This quality control process for proteins of the secretory pathway scans protein folding and discovers misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the organelle, destined for folding of these proteins and their further delivery to their site of action.  Misfolded lumenal and membrane proteins of the ER are detected by chaperones and lectins and retro-translocated out of the ER for degradation.   After polyubiquitylation of the protein substrate, Cdc48 together with its dimeric co-factor complex Ufd1-Npl4 pulls the misfolded protein out and away from the ER membrane and delivers it to down-stream components for degradation by a cytosolic proteinase machine, the proteasome.  Recognition and elimination of misfolded proteins are essential cellular processes.  More than thirty percent of the cellular proteins are proteins of the secretory pathway.  They fold in the lumen or membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum from where they are sorted to their site of action.  The folding process, as well as any refolding after cell stress, depends on chaperone activity.  In case proteins are unable to acquire their native conformation, chaperones with different substrate specificity and activity guide them to elimination.  For most misfolded proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum this requires retro-translocation to the cytosol and polyubiquitylation of the misfolded protein by an endoplasmic reticulum associated machinery.  Thereafter ubiquitylated proteins are guided to the proteasome for degradation.  The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway eliminates aberrant proteins from the ER.  Terminally misfolded or unassembled proteins are degraded by the cytoplasmic ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in a process known as ERAD (endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation).  Endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) is a protein quality control mechanism that minimizes the detrimental effects of protein misfolding in the secretory pathway.  Molecular chaperones and ER lumenal lectins are essential components of this process because they maintain the solubility of unfolded proteins and can target ERAD substrates to the cytoplasmic proteasome.  Other factors are likely required to aid in the selection of ERAD substrates, and distinct proteinaceous machineries are required for substrate retrotranslocation/dislocation from the ER and proteasome targeting.  The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control processes recognize and remove aberrant proteins from the secretory pathway.  Several variants of the plasma protein fibrinogen are recognized as aberrant and degraded by ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD), thus leading to hypofibrinogenemia.  The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the eukaryotic organelle where most secretory proteins are folded for subsequent delivery to their site of action.  Proper folding of newly synthesized proteins is monitored by a stringent ER quality control system.  This system recognizes misfolded or unassembled proteins and prevents them from reaching their final destination.  Instead, they are extracted from the ER, polyubiquitinated and degraded by the cytosolic proteasome.  Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which is caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER, elicits an adaptive response, the unfolded protein response (UPR).  One component of the UPR, the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) system, has an important function in the survival of ER stressed cells.  Proteins that fail to fold properly as well as constitutive or regulated short-lived proteins of the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) are subjected to proteolysis by cytosolic 26 S proteasomes.  This process, termed ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD), has also been implicated in the generation of some important human disorders, for example, cystic fibrosis.  To become accessible to the proteasome, ERAD substrates must first be retrogradely transported from the ER into the cytosol, in a process termed dislocation.  Surprisingly, protein dislocation from the ER seems to require at least some components that also mediate import into this compartment.  Moreover, polyubiquitination of ERAD substrates at the ER membrane as well as the cytoplasmic Cdc48p/Npl4p/Ufd1p complex were shown to contribute to this export reaction.  Proteins that fail to fold properly as well as constitutive or regulated short-lived proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum are subjected to proteolysis by cytosolic 26S proteasomes.  This process is known as endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation.  In order to become accessible to the proteasome of this system substrates must first be retrogradely transported from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol, in a process termed dislocation.  This export step seems to be accompanied by polyubiquitination of such molecules.  Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) disposes of aberrant proteins in the secretory pathway.  Protein substrates of ERAD are dislocated via the Sec61p translocon from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol, where they are ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome.  Membrane and secretory proteins fold in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and misfolded proteins may be retained and targeted for ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD).  The endoplasmic reticulum contains a protein quality control system that discovers malfolded or unassembled secretory proteins and subjects them to degradation in the cytosol.  This requires retrograde transport of the respective proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum back to the cytosol via the Sec61 translocon.  In addition, a fully competent ubiquitination machinery and the 26 S proteasome are necessary for retrotranslocation and degradation.  Ubiquitination of mutated and malfolded proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum is dependent mainly on the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc7p.  In addition, several new membrane components of the endoplasmic reticulum are required for degradation.  The quality control system in the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotic cells ensures that newly synthesized proteins that fail to fold into the correct conformation or unassembled orphan subunits of oligomeric proteins are rapidly eliminated by proteolytic degradation.  This entails the export of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol followed by their destruction by the cytosolic ubiquitin/proteasome pathway.  While this mechanism effectively prevents the cellular accumulation of non-functional or unwanted endogenous proteins, it renders the cell vulnerable to certain viruses and toxins that are able to subvert this degradative mechanism for their own advantage.  Endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation.  Until recently, the degradation of aberrant and unassembled proteins retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was thought to involve unidentified ER-localized proteases.  We now show that the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of two mutant proteins that accumulate in the ER lumen is inhibited in a proteasome-defective yeast strain and when cytosol from this mutant is used in an in vitro assay.  In addition, ERAD is limited in vitro in the presence of the proteasome inhibitors, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin and lactacystin.  We conclude that lumenal ERAD substrates are exported from the yeast ER to the cytoplasm for degradation by the proteasome complex.  Misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are eliminated by a process known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD), which starts with misfolded protein recognition, followed by ubiquitination, retrotranslocation to the cytosol, deglycosylation, and targeting to the proteasome for degradation.  Early secretory and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized proteins that are terminally misfolded or misassembled are degraded by a ubiquitin- and proteasome-mediated process known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD).  Proteins that fail to correctly fold or assemble into oligomeric complexes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are degraded by a ubiquitin- and proteasome-dependent process known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD).  Proteins that cannot fold properly will be directed to a process known as endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD).  Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) is an essential quality control process whereby misfolded proteins are exported from the endoplasmic reticulum and degraded by the proteasome in the cytosol.  Quality control mechanisms in the endoplasmic reticulum prevent deployment of aberrant or unwanted proteins to distal destinations and target them to degradation by a process known as endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation, or ERAD.  Proteins that fail to fold in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or cannot find a pattern for assembly are often disposed of by a process named ER-associated degradation (ERAD), which involves transport of the substrate protein across the ER membrane (dislocation) followed by rapid proteasome-mediated proteolysis.  Quality control mechanisms in the endoplasmic reticulum prevent deployment of aberrant or unwanted proteins to distal destinations and target them to degradation by a process known as endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation, or ERAD Misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are eliminated by a process known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD), which starts with misfolded protein recognition, followed by ubiquitination, retrotranslocation to the cytosol, deglycosylation, and targeting to the proteasome for degradation Misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are dislocated out of the ER to the cytosol, polyubiquitinated, and degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system in a process collectively termed ER-associated degradation (ERAD) Eukaryotic organisms have evolved a highly conserved endoplasmic reticulum-mediated protein quality control (ERQC) mechanism to monitor folding processes of secretory and membrane proteins, allowing export of only correctly folded proteins to their physiological destinations, retaining incompletely/mis-folded ones in the ER for additional folding attempts, marking and removing terminally misfolded ones via a unique multiple-step degradation process known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD)
###question: Which biological process in known as Endoplasmic Reticulum-Associated Protein Degradation (ERAD)?[EOC] [SOR]###response: Endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) is the quality control system in the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotic cells which ensures that newly synthesized proteins that fail to fold into the correct conformation or unassembled orphan subunits of oligomeric proteins are rapidly eliminated by proteolytic degradation.  This entails the export of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol followed by their destruction by the cytosolic ubiquitin/proteasome pathway.  While this mechanism effectively prevents the cellular accumulation of non-functional or unwanted endogenous proteins, it renders the cell vulnerable to certain viruses and toxins that are able to subvert this degradative mechanism for their own advantage.

"[SOC]###context: MRPL53, a New Candidate Gene for Orofacial Clefting, Identified Using an eQTL Approach.  A valuable approach to understand how individual and population genetic differences can predispose to disease is to assess the impact of genetic variants on cellular functions (e. g. , gene expression) of cell and tissue types related to pathological states.  To understand the genetic basis of nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P) susceptibility, a complex and highly prevalent congenital malformation, we searched for genetic variants with a regulatory role in a disease-related tissue, the lip muscle (orbicularis oris muscle [OOM]), of affected individuals.  From 46 OOM samples, which are frequently discarded during routine corrective surgeries on patients with orofacial clefts, we derived mesenchymal stem cells and correlated the individual genetic variants with gene expression from these cultured cells.  Through this strategy, we detected significant cis-eQTLs (i. e. , DNA variants affecting gene expression) and selected a few candidates to conduct an association study in a large Brazilian cohort (624 patients and 668 controls).  This resulted in the discovery of a novel susceptibility locus for NSCL/P, rs1063588, the best eQTL for the MRPL53 gene, where evidence for association was mostly driven by the Native American ancestry component of our Brazilian sample.  MRPL53 (2p13. 1) encodes a 39S protein subunit of mitochondrial ribosomes and interacts with MYC, a transcription factor required for normal facial morphogenesis.

Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFTs) are characterized by the t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation that generates the Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 and Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (EWS-FLI1) fusion transcription factor responsible for the highly malignant phenotype of this tumor.  The chromosomal translocation producing the EWS/FLI1 fusion transcript characterizes clinical Ewing sarcoma.  Translocation of chromosomes 11 and 22 in choroidal metastatic Ewing sarcoma detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization.  Molecular detection of the t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation in Ewing sarcoma is valuable in the differential diagnosis of small round cell tumors.  This patient illustrates the second reported occurrence of primary Ewing sarcoma in the stomach and the first reported with the t(11;22)(q24;q12) gene translocation.  Translocations involving ETS-transcription factors, most commonly leading to the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion protein, are the hallmark of Ewing sarcoma.  EWS-Fli1, a fusion gene resulting from a chromosomal translocation t(11;22, q24;q12) and found in Ewing sarcoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumors, encodes a transcriptional activator and promotes cellular transformation.  The presence of the t(11;22)(q24;ql2) translocation should probably not be considered diagnostic of Ewing sarcoma and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor in the absence of supporting histological evidence.  Ewing sarcoma is the prototypical member of this group of sarcomas; it was the first to be recognized pathologically as a singular entity and to have its signature translocation defined cytogenetically, which led to the identification of its key driver alteration, the EWS-FLI1 gene fusion that encodes this aberrant, chimeric transcription factor.  The hallmark of Ewings sarcoma (EWS) is a translocation--t(11;22)(q24;q12)--that most frequently results in the EWS/FLI1 aberrant chimeric gene.

"[SOC]###context: The illicit drugs more commonly associated with stroke are psychomotor stimulants, such as amphetamine and cocaine.  Less commonly implicated are opioids and psychotomimetic drugs, including cannabis.  Among 326 patients (184 males), the most frequent stroke risk factors overall were dyslipidaemia (187), smoking (161), hypertension (105) and obesity (92).  Fifty-one patients used illicit drugs, mostly comprising marijuana and amphetamines.  Patients in Adelaide are more likely to be obese, to be misusing marijuana and amphetamines, to suffer a cardioembolic event and to have a stroke that concurrently affects both the anterior and posterior cerebral circulation.  RCVS was spontaneous in 37% of patients and secondary in the 63% others, to postpartum in 5 and to exposure to various vasoactive substances in 37, mainly cannabis, selective serotonin-recapture inhibitors and nasal decongestants.  We reported two cases of young stroke associated with drug misuse.  Case 1 used amphetamine, cocaine, marijuana and LSD for few yaers, and developed occlusion of a middle cerebral artery.  Case 2 presented aphasia shortly after marijuana smoking.  Marijuana may have accelerated stroke onset, but essential cause of stroke in this case must be protein S mutation.  Cannabis is the most widely consumed among the illicit drugs worldwide, but it has only exceptionally been associated to cerebrovascular disease.  We here describe 2 young patients (26 and 29 years, respectively) who suffered from ischemic stroke in temporal relation with cannabis consumption.  The review of the literature on this topic reveals another 18 patients with stroke in association to cannabis use.  Although a causal relationship is difficult to establish due to the widespread use of cannabis, this drug may play an etiologic role in ischemic stroke.  Marijuana may trigger a myocardial infarction and have a vasospastic effect.  Despite the fact that cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug, there are only a few reports associating its use with cerebrovascular disease.  We describe a patient who suffered three ischaemic strokes immediately after cannabis consumption.  Cannabis use may be associated with ischaemic stroke in young patients, but its mechanism is unclear.  A right occipital ischemic stroke occurred in a 37-year-old Albanese man with a previously uneventful medical history, 15 min after having smoked a cigarette with approximately 250 mg of marijuana.  Therefore, as the family history for cerebrovascular events, blood pressure, clotting tests, examinations for thrombophilia, vasculitis, extracranial and intracranial arteries and cardiac investigations were normal or respectively negative, the stroke was attributed to the chronic cannabis consumption.  Three adolescent males had similar presentations of headache, fluctuating level of consciousness or lethargy, visual disturbance, and variable ataxia after self-administration of marijuana.  Episodic marijuana use may represent a risk factor for stroke in childhood, particularly in the posterior circulation.  Although several mechanisms exist by which marijuana use might contribute to the development of chronic cardiovascular conditions or acutely trigger cardiovascular events, there are few data regarding marijuana/THC use and cardiovascular disease outcomes.  Reported here is the case of a previously healthy young man who smoked marijuana on a daily basis and had an occipital lobe stroke; he was found to be heterozygous for factor V Leiden.  This case suggests that marijuana smoking may increase the risk of arterial thrombosis in otherwise healthy individuals who are heterozygous for factor V Leiden.  Thus, chronic abuse of marijuana might be a risk factor for stroke.  A 22-year-old man with a five-year history of drug and alcohol abuse presented with a left hemiparesis preceded by three transient ischaemic attacks, two of which occurred whilst smoking cannabis.  Substance abuse was the only identifiable risk factor for cerebrovascular disease.  Chronic marijuana smoking, however, seems to reduce CBF.  Research directions might include more studies of cardiovascular disease outcomes and relationships of marijuana with cardiovascular risk factors, studies of metabolic and physiologic effects of chronic marijuana use that may affect cardiovascular disease risk, increased understanding of the role of the cannabinoid receptor system in cardiovascular regulation, and studies to determine if there is a therapeutic role for cannabinoids in blood pressure control or for neuroprotection after stroke. 
###question: Is marijuana use associated with increased risk for stroke?[EOC] [SOR]###response: Yes, the use of marijuana is associated with increased risk for ischemic stroke, especially in young adults.  The mechanisms underlying such association remain largely unclear, but increased vascular reactivity and increased cerebrovascular resistance were implicated. [EOR]"

"[SOC]###context: Denosumab is a RANK-ligand antibody that was approved by the FDA in 2010 for the prevention of skeletal fractures in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors.   The authors present the imaging findings and technical report of an attempted percutaneous vertebroplasty in the only patient found to be actively under treatment with denosumab after a retrospective review of the databank of patients with pathological fractures referred to the Department Radiology of the Ohio State University for percutaneous vertebroplasty (a total sample of 20 patients) since the FDA approval of denosumab (November 2010) until June of 2013 (a 30-month period).  On the basis of this data, the FDA approved denosumab for the treatment of patients whose GCTB is unresectable, or when surgery is likely to result in severe morbidity.  Denosumab (Prolia®) is a fully human monoclonal antibody for RANKL, which selectively inhibits osteoclastogenesis, being recently approved for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in women at a high or increased risk of fracture by the FDA in the United Sates and by the European Medicines Agency in Europe since June 2010.  Recent phase II clinical trials with denosumab in skeletally mature adolescents over age 12 years and adults with GCTB, have shown both safety and efficacy, leading to its accelerated US FDA approval on 13 June 2013.   Zoledronic acid (ZA), an intravenously administered bisphosphonate, and Denosumab, a subcutaneously administered inhibitor of nuclear factor B ligand (RANKL), have already been approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for their use in treatment of bone metastases.  These results led to the approval of denosumab by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for the prevention of SREs in adults with bone metastases from solid tumors, including breast cancer.  Alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid, denosumab, and teriparatide are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapeutic options.   Several of these therapies have recently been approved by the FDA to treat bone cancer pain (bisphosphonates, denosumab) and others are currently being evaluated in human clinical trials (tanezumab).  A fourth agent, denosumab (bone targeted therapy) was also recently approved by the FDA for patients with bone metastasis after showing a reduction in the occurrence of skeletal-related events.   AHRQ published an updated review in March 2012 that summarized the benefits and risks of osteoporosis medications in treatment and prevention of osteoporosis, including bisphosphonates (aledronate, risedronate, ibandronate, zoledronic acid), parathyroid hormone, teriparatide, calcitonin, estrogens (for prevention in postmenopausal women), selective estrogen receptor modulators (raloxifene), and denosumab(approved by the FDA in 2010).

Recently, the US FDA and the EMA approved denosumab (a fully human monoclonal antibody) to treat skeletal-related events in bone-metastatic prostate cancer.  In addition to these new and emerging therapeutic agents, denosumab was approved for the prevention of skeletal complications in patients with bone metastases due to solid tumor malignancies, providing an alternative to zoledronic acid.   Recently, denosumab was FDA-approved for prevention of SREs in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors.   In the 2010s to date, an additional 3 antibodies (denosumab, belimumab, ipilimumab) have been approved and one antibody-drug conjugate (brentuximab vedotin) is undergoing regulatory review and may be approved in the US by August 30, 2011.  We also review the evidence supporting the FDA's approval of denosumab (bone-targeted therapy) as a treatment option for men with CRPC and bony metastases.

"[SOC]###context: Survivin (BIRC5) is one of the members of IAP-family apoptosis inhibitors.  The BIRCS gene is expressed in most human embryonic tissues and malignant tumors but not in normal differentiated tissues of adult human.  Survivin is an inhibitor of apoptosis that is undetectable in most terminally differentiated normal human tissues, strongly expressed in embryonic and fetal organs and is strongly expressed in many different human cancers.  Survivin is a member of the inhibitor apoptosis family that is overexpressed in many malignancies.  It has five known alternative splice forms, some of which differ in their antiapoptotic properties and expression levels in human cancers.  survivin is usually not expressed in normal adult tissues, AZD1152-hQPA induced caspase-dependent apoptosis of some cell lines, demonstrated by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, activation of caspase-9, followed by activation of caspase-3.  This effect was accompanied by the inhibition of survivin expression.  In vivo efficacy was determined in NOD/SCID/γc(null) mice implanted with the Ramos human BL cell line.  AZD1152 had anti-tumour effects in this murine xenograft model.  There preclinical data suggest that the inhibition of Aurora B kinase is a potentially useful therapeutic strategy in BL and HL.  a novel antiapoptosis gene, i. e. , survivin, was identified as a structurally unique member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family.  Survivin expression is turned off during fetal development and not found in non-neoplastic adult human tissues but is again turned on in the most common human cancers.  The antiapoptotic properties of survivin might provide a significant growth advantage in tumors and possibly also contribute to chemoresistance of cancer.  Further comparison of the distribution of PDEF with other widely recognized cancer-associated molecules showed that PDEF has more restricted distributions than Her-2/neu, Bcl-2, survivin or telomerase in cDNA libraries from normal human tissues and more increased distribution than Her-2/neu, CA-125, Bcl-2, survivin and telomerase in cDNA libraries from brain (except survivin), breast, lung and ovarian tumors.  These data together show a better tumor-association for PDEF and suggest that PDEF is a more suitable target for developing specific cancer therapies.  we identified decreased FHIT expression resulting in apoptosis inhibition and decreasing apoptosis associated with abnormal levels of some pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins (Bax, Bcl-2 and Survivin) by TUNEL and TMA.  Our results demonstrated that the mutation in the FHIT gene significantly reduced FHIT expression in human CRC.  Both TUNEL and TMA experiments demonstrated significantly inhibited apoptosis by down-regulation of Bax and up-regulation of Survivin and Bcl-2.  Collectively, these studies identify the mechanism by which an important tumor suppressor gene, FHIT, inactivated specifically in human CRC, and contributes to our understanding of the mechanism of colorectal carcinogenesis. 
###question: Is it possible to detect survivin protein expression in normal human adult tissues?[EOC] [SOR]###response: No.  Survivin is an inhibitor of apoptosis that is undetectable in normal differentiated tissues of adult human. [EOR]"
"[SOC]###context: Comprehensive BRCA mutation analysis in the Greek population.  Experience from a single clinical diagnostic center.  Germline mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are associated with hereditary predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer.  Sensitive and accurate detection of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations is crucial for personalized clinical management of individuals affected by breast or ovarian cancer, and for the identification of at-risk healthy relatives.  We performed molecular analysis of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in 898 Greek families, using Sanger sequencing or Next Generation Sequencing for the detection of small insertion/deletion frameshift, nonsynonymous, truncating and splice-site alterations and MLPA for the detection of large genomic rearrangements.  In total, a pathogenic mutation was identified in 12. 9% of 898 families analyzed.  Of the 116 mutations identified in total 9% were novel and 14. 7% were large genomic rearrangements.  Our results indicate that different types of mutational events in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are responsible for the hereditary component of breast/ovarian cancer in the Greek population.  Therefore the methodology used in the analysis of Greek patients must be able to detect both point and small frameshift mutations in addition to large genomic rearrangements across the entire coding region of the two genes.

"[SOC]###context: Only 37 cases of stroke during or soon after long-haul flights have been published to our knowledge.   Our centre admitted 5727 stroke patients, of whom 42 (0. 73%) had flight-related strokes.  The authors report three cases of ischemic stroke in young adults that occurred during or after an airplane flight. 
###question: Is airplane stroke syndrome a common disease. [EOC] [SOR]###response: No.  Only 37 cases of stroke during or soon after long-haul flights have been published.  A single center study reported that 42 out of 5727 stroke admissions (0. 73%) were flight-related strokes. [EOR]"
"[SOC]###context: After 3 days of rest, RIC was carried out, consisting of 4 Gy total body irradiation, antithymocyte globulin (ATG-Fresenius), and cyclophosphamide (fludarabine, amsacrine, and cytarabine (FLAMSA)-RIC protocol).  We report a retrospective single center analysis of aplasia-inducing chemotherapy using fludarabine, cytarabine, and amsacrine (FLAMSA) followed by reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in 62 consecutive primary refractory or relapsed AML patients.  A sequential regimen of cytoreductive chemotherapy (fludarabine, high-dose AraC, amsacrine) followed by reduced intensity conditioning (FLAMSA-RIC), was uniformly used for conditioning.  Between November 2003 and June 2010, 30 patients (20 high-risk MDS, 10 sAML) received fludarabine (4 × 30 mg/m(2)), amsacrine (4 × 100 mg/m(2)), and Ara-C (4 × 2 g/m(2), FLAMSA).   The preparative regimen consisted of fludarabine, Ara-C and amsacrine (FLAMSA) chemotherapy, followed by reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) 3 days later.   Fifteen patients received fludarabine 30 mg/m(2), cytarabine 2000 mg/m(2), amsacrine 100 mg/m(2) on days -10, -9, -8 and -7, anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG-Fresenius) 20 mg/kg body weight on days -6, -5 and -4 and fractionated total body irradiation 2 x 2 Gy on days -3, -2 and -1 (FLAMSA-ATG-TBI) before allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.   The goal of this analysis was to define the role of the moderate-intensity fludarabin Ara-C amsacrin (FLAMSA)-reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen for patients with high-risk AML undergoing allogeneic SCT (alloSCT) in first CR1.
