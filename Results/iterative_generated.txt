MacroH2A1 nucleosomes are widely distributed across the genome, their local concentration varies over a range of 100-fold or more.  The transcribed regions of most active genes are depleted of macroH2A1, often in sharply localized domains that show depletion of 4-fold or more relative to bulk mouse liver chromatin.  The Xi chromosome contains approximately 1. 5-fold more mH2A1 than the autosomes.  The data show that mH2A1 is uniformly distributed across the entire Xi chromosome.  Interestingly, a stronger mH2A1 enrichment along the pseudoautosomal X chromosome region was observed in both sexes.  MacroH2A1 is enriched on the inactive X chromosome in female mammalian cells, where it functions to maintain gene silencing.  MacroH2A1 is concentrated on the inactive X chromosome, consistent with our previous immunofluorescence studies.  These results support the hypothesis that macroH2As function as transcriptional repressors.  Taking into account the properties of macroH2A toward chromatin structure and dynamics and its role in gene repression our data suggest that the increased expression of macroH2A and the hypermethylation of DNA which occurs upon winter-acclimatization plays a major role for the reorganization of chromatin structure and the regulation of gene expression during the physiological adaptation to a colder environment.  Inactivation is a multistep process that involves a large non-coding RNA termed XIST, a variety of epigenetic modifications of chromatin, and alterations in protein composition such as enrichment of the histone variant macroH2A.  One of several features acquired by chromatin of the inactive X chromosome (Xi) is enrichment for the core histone H2A variant macroH2A within a distinct nuclear structure referred to as a macrochromatin body (MCB).  Although the MCB dissipates during late S phase and G2 before reforming in late G1, macroH2A1 remains associated during mitosis with specific regions of the Xi, including at the X inactivation center.
Yes, the HRC is related to arrhythmias and cardiac disease.
Yes, TFII-I is a transcription factor that positively or negatively regulates gene expression.  TFII-I has been implicated in neuronal and immunologic diseases as well as in thymic epithelial cancer.  Williams-Beuren Syndrome (WBS) is caused by a large hemizygous deletion on chromosome 7q11. 23 which encompasses 26-28 genes, including GTF2I, the human gene encoding TFII-I.  A subset of WBS patients has recently been shown to present with macrocytosis, a mild anemia characterized by enlarged erythrocytes.  We conditionally deleted the TFII-I/Gtf2i gene in adult mice by tamoxifen induced Cre-recombination.  Bone marrow cells revealed defects in erythro-megakaryopoiesis and an increase in expression of the adult β-globin gene.  The data show that TFII-I acts as a repressor of β-globin gene transcription and that it is implicated in the differentiation of erythro-megakaryocytic cells.
K-48 linked protein ubiquitination is involved in the processing of NF-κB precursors and the degradation of inhibitor of kappa B (IκB) proteins.
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in the Caucasian population, affecting approximately 1 in 2,000 newborns but the actual estimate varies with the geographic location.
Meigs' syndrome is a benign ovarian tumor associated with ascites and pleural effusion.  Although postmenopausal women with ovarian tumor, ascites, pleural effusion, and elevation of CA-125 levels probably have malignant ovarian tumors, Meigs' syndrome must be considered in the differential diagnosis.  Meigs' syndrome should be considered at the differential diagnosis for a patient with pelvic mass, pleural effusion and ascites with normal cytology, increased CA125 levels.  When benign ovarian fibroma is associated with ascites and/or pleural effusion it is termed Meigs syndrome.
Yes, NEECHAM Confusion Scale can be used for evaluation of postoperative delirium.
Finerenone is a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. 
Yes, Apremilast is effective for Behcet’s syndrome.  Apremilast is an immunomodulatory agent that works through phosphodiesterase 4 inhibition.  A randomized controlled trial has shown that it is effective for the management of oral and genital ulcers and is generally well tolerated. 
Yes, there are focused databases from which you can retrieve gene expression data on renal disease.  The Kidney Genome Atlas (KGA) is a database that contains gene expression data from human kidney tissues and cell lines.
Yes, TNNI3K is a cardiac-specific protein.
Quadracel is a new vaccination developed to condense the last dose of both DTaP and IPV so they do not have to be given separately, thus reducing the total number of vaccinations required.
No Promoter Left Behind (NPLB) is an efficient, organism-independent method for characterizing such diverse architectures directly from experimentally identified genome-wide TSSs, without relying on known promoter elements.
Yes, c-met is involved in the activation of the Akt pathway.
Spermidine protects against α-synuclein neurotoxicity.  Here, we show that administration of the naturally occurring polyamine spermidine, which declines continuously during aging in various species, alleviates a series of PD-related degenerative processes in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, two established model systems for PD pathology.  In the fruit fly, simple feeding with spermidine inhibited loss of climbing activity and early organismal death upon heterologous expression of human α-synuclein, which is thought to be the principal toxic trigger of PD.  In this line, administration of spermidine rescued α-synuclein-induced loss of dopaminergic neurons, a hallmark of PD, in nematodes.  Together with the fact that spermidine facilitates late stages of α-Syn aggregation, our data demonstrate that spermidine promotes the very early stages of protein aggregation including α-Syn misfolding and dimerization.  This finding suggests that increased levels of spermidine and potentially other polyamines can initiate the disease-related process of α-Syn.
Yes, tamoxifen was tested for treatment of glioma patients.  It was tested in a phase II trial.  It was also tested in a phase I clinical trial assessing temozolomide and tamoxifen with concomitant radiotherapy for treatment of high-grade glioma.
KP4 is a virally encoded fungal toxin secreted by the P4 killer strain of Ustilago maydis.
No, splicing speckles are not associated with transcription.  Splicing speckles are major nuclear domains rich in components of the splicing machinery and polyA(+) RNA.  Although speckles contain little detectable transcriptional activity, they are found preferentially associated with specific mRNA-coding genes and gene-rich R bands, and they accumulate some unspliced pre-mRNAs.  RNA polymerase II transcribes mRNAs and is required for splicing, with some reports suggesting that the inactive complexes are stored in splicing speckle.  Localization of eIF4A-III in the nucleolus and splicing speckles is an indicator of plant stress.  Analysis of a HeLa cell line stably expressing EYFP-NHPX showed that the nucleolar accumulation of NHPX was preceded by its transient accumulation in splicing speckles.  In vivo analysis of NHPX reveals a novel nucleolar localization pathway involving a transient accumulation in splicing speckles.
