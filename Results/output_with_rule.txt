The histone variant macroH2A is enriched in the inactive X chromosome in female mammalian cells.  In contrast, macroH2A was concentrated on the inactive X chromosome, consistent with our previous immunofluorescence studies.  These results support the hypothesis that macroH2As function as transcriptional repressors.  Taking into account the properties of macroH2A toward chromatin structure and dynamics and its role in gene repression our data suggest that the increased expression of macroH2A and the hypermethylation of DNA which occurs upon winter-acclimatization plays a major role for the reorganization of chromatin structure and the regulation of gene expression during the physiological adaptation to a colder environment.  Inactivation is a multistep process that involves a large non-coding RNA termed XIST, a variety of epigenetic modifications of chromatin, and alterations in protein composition such as enrichment of the histone variant macroH2A.  One of several features acquired by chromatin of the inactive X chromosome (Xi) is enrichment for the core histone H2A variant macroH2A within a distinct nuclear structure referred to as a macrochromatin body (MCB).  In addition to localizing to the MCB, macroH2A accumulates at a perinuclear structure centered at the centrosome.  Although the MCB dissipates during late S phase and G2 before reforming in late G1, macroH2A1 remains associated during mitosis with specific regions of the Xi, including at the X inactivation center.  The transcribed regions of most active genes are depleted of macroH2A1, often in sharply localized domains that show depletion of 4-fold or more relative to bulk mouse liver chromatin.  By using highly specific antibodies against mH2A1 and stable HEK 293 cell lines expressing either green fluorescent protein (GFP)-mH2A1 or GFP-H2A, we found that the Xi chromosome contains approximately 1. 5-fold more mH2A1 than the autosomes.  Interestingly, a stronger mH2A1 enrichment along the pseudoautosom

TFII-I is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor that positively or negatively regulates gene expression.  TFII-I has been implicated in neuronal and immunologic diseases as well as in thymic epithelial cancer.  Williams-Beuren Syndrome (WBS) is caused by a large hemizygous deletion on chromosome 7q11. 23 which encompasses 26-28 genes, including GTF2I, the human gene encoding TFII-I.  A subset of WBS patients has recently been shown to present with macrocytosis, a mild anemia characterized by enlarged erythrocytes.  We conditionally deleted the TFII-I/Gtf2i gene in adult mice by tamoxifen induced Cre-recombination.  Bone marrow cells revealed defects in erythro-megakaryopoiesis and an increase in expression of the adult β-globin gene.  The data show that TFII-I acts as a repressor of β-globin gene transcription and that it is implicated in the differentiation of erythro-megakaryocytic cells.

Meigs' syndrome is a benign ovarian tumor associated with ascites and pleural effusion.  Although postmenopausal women with ovarian tumor, ascites, pleural effusion, and elevation of CA-125 levels probably have malignant ovarian tumors, Meigs' syndrome must be considered in the differential diagnosis.

Quadracel is a new vaccination developed to condense the last dose of both DTaP and IPV so they do not have to be given separately, thus reducing the total number of vaccinations required.  In a randomized, controlled, phase 3, pivotal trial, Quadracel proved to be as efficacious and safe as Daptacel (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine adsorbed, Sanofi Pasteur Inc. ) and IPOL (poliovirus vaccine inactivated, Sanofi Pasteur Inc. ), given separately, to children between the ages of 4 and 6 years.

Yes, c-met is involved in the activation of the Akt pathway. 
Spermidine protects against α-synuclein neurotoxicity.  Here, we show that administration of the naturally occurring polyamine spermidine, which declines continuously during aging in various species, alleviates a series of PD-related degenerative processes in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, two established model systems for PD pathology.  In the fruit fly, simple feeding with spermidine inhibited loss of climbing activity and early organismal death upon heterologous expression of human α-synuclein, which is thought to be the principal toxic trigger of PD.  In this line, administration of spermidine rescued α-synuclein-induced loss of dopaminergic neurons, a hallmark of PD, in nematodes.  Together with the fact that spermidine facilitates late stages of α-Syn aggregation, our data demonstrate that spermidine promotes the very early stages of protein aggregation including α-Syn misfolding and dimerization.  This finding suggests that increased levels of spermidine and potentially other polyamines can initiate the disease-related process of α-Syn.

Splicing speckles are major nuclear domains rich in components of the splicing machinery and polyA(+) RNA.  Although speckles contain little detectable transcriptional activity, they are found preferentially associated with specific mRNA-coding genes and gene-rich R bands, and they accumulate some unspliced pre-mRNAs RNA polymerase II transcribes mRNAs and is required for splicing, with some reports suggesting that the inactive complexes are stored in splicing speckle In normal cell growth conditions GFPeIF4A-III was mainly nucleoplasmic, but in hypoxia stress conditions it moved to the nucleolus and splicing speckles.  Localization of eIF4A-III in the nucleolus and splicing speckles is an indicator of plant stress.   Using antibodies raised against mouse RBM6 to immunostain mammalian cell lines we found that the endogenous protein was both distributed diffusely in the nucleus and concentrated in a small number of nuclear foci that corresponded to splicing speckles/interchromatin granule clusters (IGCs Subnuclear targeting of the RNA-binding motif protein RBM6 to splicing speckles and nascent transcripts.
