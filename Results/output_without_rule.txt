The macroH2A histone variant is enriched on the inactive X chromosome in female mammalian cells, where it functions to maintain gene silencing.  The data show that mH2A1 is uniformly distributed across the entire Xi chromosome.  Interestingly, a stronger mH2A1 enrichment along the pseudoautosomal X chromosome region was observed in both sexes.  macroH2A1 nucleosomes were enriched on endogenous MLVs, with the highest enrichment occurring on the 5' end of pro-pol macroH2A1 is enriched on the inactive X chromosome in female mammalian cells, where it functions to maintain gene silencing.  We found that macroH2A1 was depleted on the transcribed regions of active genes In contrast, macroH2A1 was concentrated on the inactive X chromosome, consistent with our previous immunofluorescence studies.  These results support the hypothesis that macroH2As function as transcriptional repressors Taking into account the properties of macroH2A toward chromatin structure and dynamics and its role in gene repression our data suggest that the increased expression of macroH2A and the hypermethylation of DNA which occurs upon winter-acclimatization plays a major role for the reorganization of chromatin structure and the regulation of gene expression during the physiological adaptation to a colder environment Inactivation is a multistep process that involves a large non-coding RNA termed XIST, a variety of epigenetic modifications of chromatin, and alterations in protein composition such as enrichment of the histone variant macroH2A One of several features acquired by chromatin of the inactive X chromosome (Xi) is enrichment for the core histone H2A variant macroH2A within a distinct nuclear structure referred to as a macrochromatin body (MCB) In addition to localizing to the MCB, macroH2A accumulates at a perinuclear structure centered at the centrosome The centrosomal pool of macroH2A1 accumulates in the presence of an inhibitor of the 20S proteasome.  Although the MCB dissipates during late S phase and G2
Yes, the Histidine-Rich Calcium Binding protein (HRC) is related to arrhythmias and cardiac disease.  The Ser96Ala variant in histidine-rich calcium-binding protein is associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.  Interestingly, HRC has been linked with familiar cardiac conduction disease and an HRC polymorphism was shown to associate with malignant ventricular arrhythmias in the background of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. 
Yes, TFII-I is a transcription factor that positively or negatively regulates gene expression.  TFII-I has been implicated in neuronal and immunologic diseases as well as in thymic epithelial cancer.  Williams-Beuren Syndrome (WBS) is caused by a large hemizygous deletion on chromosome 7q11. 23 which encompasses 26-28 genes, including GTF2I, the human gene encoding TFII-I.  A subset of WBS patients has recently been shown to present with macrocytosis, a mild anemia characterized by enlarged erythrocytes.  We conditionally deleted the TFII-I/Gtf2i gene in adult mice by tamoxifen induced Cre-recombination.  Bone marrow cells revealed defects in erythro-megakaryopoiesis and an increase in expression of the adult β-globin gene.  The data show that TFII-I acts as a repressor of β-globin gene transcription and that it is implicated in the differentiation of erythro-megakaryocytic cells.

K-48 linked protein ubiquitination is involved in the processing of NF-κB precursors and the degradation of inhibitor of kappa B (IκB) proteins. 
The incidence of cystic fibrosis in the caucasian population is 1:2000 to 1:8000. 
Meigs' syndrome is a benign ovarian tumor associated with ascites and pleural effusion.
Yes, NEECHAM Confusion Scale can be used for evaluation of postoperative delirium. 
Finerenone is a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. 
Yes, Apremilast is effective for Behcet’s syndrome. 
Yes, there are focused databases from which you can retrieve gene expression data on renal disease. 
Yes, TNNI3K is a cardiac-specific protein. 
Quadracel is a new vaccination developed to condense the last dose of both DTaP and IPV so they do not have to be given separately, thus reducing the total number of vaccinations required.  In a randomized, controlled, phase 3, pivotal trial, Quadracel proved to be as efficacious and safe as Daptacel (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine adsorbed, Sanofi Pasteur Inc. ) and IPOL (poliovirus vaccine inactivated, Sanofi Pasteur Inc. ), given separately, to children between the ages of 4 and 6 years. 
No Promoter Left Behind (NPLB) is an efficient, organism-independent method for characterizing such diverse architectures directly from experimentally identified genome-wide TSSs, without relying on known promoter elements.
Yes, c-met is involved in the activation of the Akt pathway. 
Spermidine protects against α-synuclein neurotoxicity.  Here, we show that administration of the naturally occurring polyamine spermidine, which declines continuously during aging in various species, alleviates a series of PD-related degenerative processes in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, two established model systems for PD pathology.  In the fruit fly, simple feeding with spermidine inhibited loss of climbing activity and early organismal death upon heterologous expression of human α-synuclein, which is thought to be the principal toxic trigger of PD.  In this line, administration of spermidine rescued α-synuclein-induced loss of dopaminergic neurons, a hallmark of PD, in nematodes.  Alleviation of PD-related neurodegeneration by spermidine was accompanied by induction of autophagy, suggesting that this cytoprotective process may be responsible for the beneficial effects of spermidine administration.
